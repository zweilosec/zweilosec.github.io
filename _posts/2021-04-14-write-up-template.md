## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

Like always, I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `<ip>`. The options I regularly use are: `-p-`, which is a shortcut which tells nmap to scan all TCP ports, `-sC` is the equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target, `-sV` does a service scan, and `-oN <name>` saves the output with a filename of `<name>`.

At first my scan wouldn't go through until I added the `-Pn` flag to stop nmap from sending ICMP probes. After that it proceeded normally.
