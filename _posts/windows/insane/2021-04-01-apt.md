## HTB - APT

## Overview

![Information card for the Hack the Box machine APT](/assets/img/apt-0-infocard.png)

This Windows insane-difficulty machine was quite challenging, but mostly due to its use of some unconventional settings.  Breaking in involved many of the normal enumeration and privilege escalation techniques that are used against Windows machines, but some tweaks by the administrator made it more challenging to find out how to even begin. This machine gave me a chance to learn a lot about using some of the standard Impacket tools in new ways, such as using Kerberos tickets along with IPv6.  I hope you enjoy this challenge as much as I did!

## Useful Skills and Tools

### Using a Kerberos ticket with Impacket tools

1. First, capture a valid Kerberos ticket using the user's password hash and `GetTGT.py`.
2. Export the ticket using the command `export KRB5CCNAME=$user@$hostname.ccache`
3. Use this ticket in other Impacket tools for authentication by using the `-k` argument.

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.213`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

```text

```

Nmap only reported that two ports were open, 80 - HTTP \(IIS\) and 135 - RPC.

### Port 80 - HTTP

![A screenshot of the Gigantic Hosting website on port 80](/assets/img/apt-1-trustsec.png)

I navigated my web browser to the target IP address and found a website for a hosting company called Gigantic Hosting.  It offered security services for all hosted servers.  I found an email address associated with this `sales@gigantichosting.com`, and a phone number  `(818) 995-1560`.  

```html
<!-- Mirrored from 10.13.38.16/ by HTTrack Website Copier/3.x [XR&CO'2014], Mon, 23 Dec 2019 08:12:54 GMT -->
```

In the source code of the website I saw an IP `10.13.38.16/` mentioned in a comment alongside `HTTrack Website Copier/3.x`.  It looked like this website had been mirrored from this IP.  I tried to connect to it but there did not seem to be any hosts located there.

* [https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/May/89](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/May/89)
* [https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/131160/HTTrack-Website-Copier-3.48-21-DLL-Hijacking.html](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/131160/HTTrack-Website-Copier-3.48-21-DLL-Hijacking.html)
* [https://en.kali.tools/?p=443&PageSpeed=noscript](https://en.kali.tools/?p=443&PageSpeed=noscript)

I also looked up vulnerability information regarding the website copier, but did not find anything useful.  

![Image of the Wappalyzer plugin with version information](/assets/img/apt-2-wappalyzer.png)

Wappalyzer told me this site was hosted on IIS 10, and that it was using jQuery 1.11.0, but this did not give me any leads.  

![Image of the about page](/assets/img/apt-5-about.png)

I continued my enumeration of the website, but most of the pages on the site did not contain anything useful or interesting. 

![Dirbuster output showing many files and folders](/assets/img/apt-1-dirbuster.png)

I checked my `dirbuster` output to see if there were any interesting files or folders, but even after going through the entire raft wordlist I was not able to find anything that normal enumeration of the site didn't reveal.

![Image of the support contact form I attempted XSS and SQLi on](/assets/img/apt-6-XSS-support.png)

The `/support.html` page had a contact form that I tried some basic XSS and SQLi payloads against.  

![Image of the Firefox security warning page](/assets/img/apt-7-alert.png)

However when I submitted the form it redirected me to the IP I had seen in a comment in the source code of the website. This comment form had not been updated and was still pointing towards the site it had been copied from `(10.13.38.16)`. 

![Certificate information for 10.13.38.16](/assets/img/apt-8-certificate.png)

I opened the certificate information that was presented for this site since it was using HTTPS, but there was nothing interesting to be found.

![Burp output showing a failed connection to 10.13.38.16](/assets/img/apt-9.5-fail2.png)

I captured my request in Burp to see if it leaked any information about the site, but it also failed to connect.  I also could not ping that IP. This seemed like it was not the way forward.

### Port 135 - RPC

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]
└─$ rpcclient -I 10.10.10.213 -U "" -N apt.htb -p 135           
Cannot connect to server.  Error was NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED
```

Since port 80 seemed to be a dead end, I moved on to port 135.  However, I also wasn't able to connect to the machine using `rpcclient`. I seemed to have hit another dead end.  I decided to do some research on how to enumerate RPC without authentication.

* [https://airbus-cyber-security.com/the-oxid-resolver-part-1-remote-enumeration-of-network-interfaces-without-any-authentication/](https://airbus-cyber-security.com/the-oxid-resolver-part-1-remote-enumeration-of-network-interfaces-without-any-authentication/)
* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4622f7dc-5ccb-4aa1-80e6-b93fd796a55a](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4622f7dc-5ccb-4aa1-80e6-b93fd796a55a)

I found one promising article that described how you could use the `IOXIDResolver` interface to resolve the network interfaces of the the remote host, and even included a python script proof of concept using the `Impacket` library.  

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys, getopt

from impacket.dcerpc.v5 import transport
from impacket.dcerpc.v5.rpcrt import RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE
from impacket.dcerpc.v5.dcomrt import IObjectExporter

def main(argv):

    try:
        opts, args = getopt.getopt(argv,"ht:",["target="])
    except getopt.GetoptError:
        print('IOXIDResolver.py -t <target>')
        sys.exit(2)

    target_ip = "10.10.10.213"

    for opt, arg in opts:
        if opt == '-h':
            print('IOXIDResolver.py -t <target>')
            sys.exit()
        elif opt in ("-t", "--target"):
            target_ip = arg

    authLevel = RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE

    stringBinding = r'ncacn_ip_tcp:%s' % target_ip
    rpctransport = transport.DCERPCTransportFactory(stringBinding)

    portmap = rpctransport.get_dce_rpc()
    portmap.set_auth_level(authLevel)
    portmap.connect()

    objExporter = IObjectExporter(portmap)
    bindings = objExporter.ServerAlive2()

    print("[*] Retrieving network interface of " + target_ip)

    #NetworkAddr = bindings[0]['aNetworkAddr']
    for binding in bindings:
        NetworkAddr = binding['aNetworkAddr']
        print("Address: " + NetworkAddr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main(sys.argv[1:])
```

I copied the PoC from the site and modified the script to scan the IP of my target.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]

Address: dead:beef::4d93:3f31:7ea4:6f57
```

After running the script, I was presented with the hostname \(I assume\), the IPv4 address, and two IPv6 addresses.  I added `apt` as an alias for this IPv6 address in my `/etc/hosts` file.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 65.438/66.913/68.389/1.475 ms
```

I was relieved to find that I was able to ping the machine using the IPv6 address. The TTL of 64 was a bit odd, bu I wasn't not sure if it was normal for IPv6. It showed 127 like normal when pinging the IPv4 address.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]
└─$ rpcclient -I dead:beef::b885:d62a:d679:573f -U "" -N apt
rpcclient $>
```

Using this IPv6 address with `rpcclient` I was able to connect anonymously.

```text
rpcclient $> lsaquery
Could not initialise lsarpc. Error was NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
rpcclient $> srvinfo
        APT.HTB        Wk Sv PDC Tim NT

        os version      :       10.0
        server type     :       0x80102b
```

After getting `NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` for all of my commands I was starting to think I wasn't going to get anything, but finaly one command returned something. I got the hostname of `APT.HTB` using the `lsaquery` command.  I went through a lot of the other commands, but wasn't able to get anything else out of this.

### nmap - IPv6

Since RPC did not seem to give up much information, I decided to try scanning this new network interface to see if there was anything different that I could find.

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]

49687/tcp open  msrpc        syn-ack Microsoft Windows RPC
```

The scan did not take very long, but this time I was able to see many more ports open.  This was looking like a real Windows server now with many of the common Windows Server ports open such as 53 - DNS, 88 - Kerberos, 389 - LDAP, 445 - SMB, and 5985 - WinRM.  

Next, I researched ways to enumerate Windows using IPv6 and found a newer version of a popular tool, `enum4linux`, that supported IPv6.

* https://hacker-gadgets.com/blog/2020/12/04/enum4linux-ng-a-next-generation-version-of-enum4linux-a-windows-samba-enumeration-tool-with-additional-features-like-json-yaml-export/
* https://www.ethicalhackx.com/how-to-pwn-on-ipv6/

Using the information from this tool, I learned how to use `smbclient` with IPv6.  

```

```

Using `smbclient` I was able to get a list of network shares. The `backup` share looked like it should hold interesting information.  

![Note: Apparently Workgroups do not function over IPv6.](/assets/markups/apt-no_workgroup.svg)
### backup.zip

Inside the `backup` share I found a file `backup.zip` that I was able to exfiltrate back to my computer.

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]
└─$ unzip backup.zip

```

The zip file was password-protected, but not encrypted.  I was able to see that contents, which were a backup of the Active Directory NTDS database.  This was a very juicy find, indeed!  If I could extract these files, I could potentially get the password hashes of all of the domain users on this machine.

```

```

Next, I used `zip2john` to extract the password hash from the file.

```

Then, I loaded the hash into `john`.  It cracked in less than a second and revealed that the password was `iloveyousomuch`.

[*] Cleaning up...
```

Using Impacket's `secretsdump.py` I was able to dump all of the hashes that were stored in the database.  There were hundreds of users on this domain!  Luckily there were a couple of plaintext passwords.  I tried logging into various services using the two plaintext passwords, but didn't get anywhere.

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]
└─$ awk -F ":" '{print $1}' ntds.dump > users

┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]
└─$ wc -l users 
7996 users
```

I dumped the output from `secretsdump.py` to a file and counted the lines that contained hashes.  I was wrong before...there were almost 8000 users on this domain!!

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]

```

After looking through the dump a bit, I noticed there were duplicates.  After sorting and pulling out the unique entries there were only about...2000 or so left.  Much more manageable, but there was a lot to go through still.

```

Using `kerbrute` I was able to find only 3 valid users on this machine out of the 2000+ that had come out of the database, and one of those was only the machine account.

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]
└─$ awk -F":" '{print $3,$4}' ntds.dump | sed 's/ /:/g' > nt_hashes
```

Now I needed to find a valid hash to log in with. I cut the text from the file using `awk` and `sed` and put all of the hashes into a file by themselves.

```

Kerberos SessionError: KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED(Pre-authentication information was invalid)
```

### GetTGT.py

Using `GetTGT.py` from Impacket I was only able to check one hash as a time, but since there was no way to validate all of the hashes at once I came up with a solution.

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]

not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```

I used some bash magic to run the same command for each line in my `nt_hashes` file.  It started giving a bunch of errors for all of the lines that didn't have both halves of the hash (this script from Impacket expects both the LM and NTLM hash).

```

Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)
```

I pulled out one of the hashes and tried it with just one that was in the right format, but this time I got an error that said my clock was too far off the Domain Controller.

I installed `ntpdate` based off the suggestion of this blog, but since NTP wasn't running on the server I wasn't able to sync with it.  After playing with my system time, I decided that it had never jumped forwards for daylight savings time...

I simply synced it with a known good ntp server instead.

I still had the same problem... my VM reported one time, but the terminal reported another.  It seemed that the `date` command was way off for some reason.

### crackmapexec

I started looking for other ways to do brute force using hashes, and found that CrackMapExec was also able to do this.  

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/apt]
└─$ crackmapexec smb apt.htb.local -u henry.vinson -H nt_hashes -d htb
```

I tried using crackmapexec but it did not come up with any results. I wasn't sure if it even did anything since it didn't return any output at all.

After some research, I found it had problems with IPv6.  On GitHub I found an issue someone had brought up that addressed this issue.

* https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec/issues/339
* https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/abusing-kerberos-from-linux/
* https://bluescreenofjeff.com/2017-05-23-how-to-pass-the-ticket-through-ssh-tunnels/

Using SSH port forwarding to and from local machine, I could use my localhost IPv4 address to redirect traffic to the remote IPv6 address.  This seemed intricate, but promising.  

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[/etc/ssh]
└─$ sudo ssh zweilos@127.0.0.1 -L 445:apt.htb.local:445
```

I had to enable ssh on my machine, then set up port forwarding using SSH.  

```

```

However, other than getting the windows version I could not get any further information.

I tried many different things, and even checked to verbose debugging information, but could not identify the problem. If someone could tell me what I was doing wrong I would greatly appreciate it!!

```

The next day, my clock was magicaly working correctly. I didn't restart the system or anything (I had actually only paused the vm). This time I was able to enumerate the users (or at least was able to connect and get the PREAUTH_FAILED error instead of the Clock Skew error).  

```

Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)
```

I used a bit of bash hackery to remove the results that showed failed attempts and let it run.  (I assumed it would take a long time so I let it go and got dinner).

When I checked in on the progress, I noticed that I still received the time sync error, but this time only for one hash; all others reported PREAUTH error.

```

I checked my saved output, and saw that there was only one has that didn't trigger the PREAUTH_FAILED error.

I kept going down the list of impacket tools that seemed relevant.  I had to look up query syntax for `reg` when I came to `reg.py`.

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-query

The argument `-s` sounded useful for dumping all keys at once.  HKCU seemed like a good place to start dumping.

```

However, this also didn't seem to work.  I tried each of these Impacket tools using the `-k` option to use Kerberos authentication after exporting the key to KRB5CCNAME, but it didn't seem to authenticate with what I thought was the correct Kerberos ticket.  I decided to go back and try to troubleshoot my ticket.

```

Using the `klist` tool I found out that the ticket was expired.  I had created it the day before, but tickets have a shorter expiration than that.

```

I ran my one-liner from earlier (on just the valid hash this time) to get a new ticket.  I checked it using `klist` again and saw that the time was refreshed.

### Dumping the registry

I tried dumping the registry again using the same command and this time it took much, much, longer to output (like everything else on this machine so far!).  I was sure that it was working this time!!  I used the `-s` reg option to make it recursively get all keys.  I chose `HKEY-USER` first since it was a likely place to find potential credentials and other useful system information.  

* https://www.lifewire.com/hkey-users-2625903

> Each registry key located under the HKEY_USERS hive corresponds to a user on the system and is named with that user's security identifier, or SID. The registry keys and registry values located under each SID control settings specific to that user, like mapped drives, installed printers, environment variables, desktop background, and much more, and is loaded when the user first logs on.

```

```

Next I tried to download `HKLM` while I perused through `HKU`, but I was denied access.

```

```

Apparently this user never uses this machine, since their default search was MSNSearch. There surprisingly was actually not that much information in this registry dump.  I went back and downloaded the entire `HKU` hive to include information from all users. 

```

```

The group policy key gave a listing of the groups that existed on this machine.  I could use this to look up the well known groups by their SID.

```

I reached the end of the file and found some minorly useful information.  I started doing some searches to see if I missed something.

### Finding user creds

```
\Software\GiganticHostingManagementSystem\
        UserName        REG_SZ   henry.vinson_adm
        PassWord        REG_SZ   G1#Ny5@2dvht
```

Searching for `Password` yeilded something that I had scrolled right past in my first look through.  There was a username and password `henry.vinson_adm:G1#Ny5@2dvht`.

I used `Evil-WinRM` to log in using these credentials.  After all that, I finally had a shell!  There were no useful or interesting groups or privileges.

### Enumeration as `henry.vinson_adm`

None of the .exe versions of winPEAS worked on this machine, so I had to run the .bat instead.  I was also denied running the `systeminfo` command.  The .bat version of WinPEAS seemed to be stuck on a loop, so I started poking around in another shell manually using the things it pointed out.

The output had mentioned a few interesting files. The first I checked was `C:\Windows\Panther\unattend.xml`. These unattend files can often hold plaintext credentials. This administrator had been smart enough to remove his credentials afterwards.  It did contain some IPs and MAC information that could have been useful during a normal engagement.

```powershell
(Get-NetAdapter | Disable-NetAdapterBinding -ComponentID ms_tcpip6 -confirm:$false)
```

The base64 encoded command drew my attention, so I decoded it. It looked as if this was used to disable ipv6?

```powershell
[0;31m*Evil-WinRM*[0m[0;1;33m PS [0mC:\Users\henry.vinson_adm\Desktop> type C:\Users\henry.vinson_adm\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
$Cred = get-credential administrator
invoke-command -credential $Cred -computername localhost -scriptblock {Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" lmcompatibilitylevel -Type DWORD -Value 2 -Force}
```

The powershell history file contained something interesting. The administrator credentials had been used to run a scriptblock that set the value of a registry key

```powershell
[0;31m*Evil-WinRM*[0m[0;1;33m PS [0mC:\Users\henry.vinson_adm\Desktop> echo $Cred
```

I tried to echo the variable from the command in the history file to see if it still existed. Nope. didnt work. :laugh:

* [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/ntlm](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/ntlm) 

Some reasearch revealed some useful information about the registry key that was modified in the command from the history.

> The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers accept.

```text
Send NTLM response only | Client devices use NTLMv1 authentication, and they use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. | 2
```

A value of '2' meant that NTLM hashes would be sent if they were requested by a service. According to [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/ntlm) I could abuse the print spooler service to get the machine to send the hash to my machine, where I could capture it with `responder`.

```

I tried to get `responder` to request LM hashes using the `--lm` argument, but it gave an error telling me to supply a challenge.  The instructions on this hacktricks page are not as well written as a lot of others, but at least `responder` gave a verbose enough error message to fix the problem.

### MpCmdRun.exe

* [https://gbhackers.com/hackers-can-steal-windows-ntlm/](https://gbhackers.com/hackers-can-steal-windows-ntlm/)
* [https://github.com/Gl3bGl4z/All\_NTLM\_leak](https://github.com/Gl3bGl4z/All_NTLM_leak)

Some more research revealed a GitHub account with a good list of different ways to leak NTLM hashes. The entry on Windows Defender intrigued me.

There was an argument that allowed for the user to specify a file or directory to scan.  Remote share scanning sounded like a useful feature to exploit!

```powershell
[0;31m*Evil-WinRM*[0m[0;1;33m PS [0mC:\Users\henry.vinson_adm\Documents\test> cd "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\platform\4.18.2008.9-0\"

```

The example on the page did not work because the specified version of Windows Defender was different, but I found two newer versions in the `/platform` folder. I hoped that one of these would still be vulnerable to this issue.

However, I got a hit back on my listener! I had the NTLMv1 hash of the user `APT$`.  

### crack.sh

> Remember that the printer will use the computer account during the authentication, and computer accounts use long and random passwords that you probably won't be able to crack using common dictionaries. But the NTLMv1 authentication uses DES \(more info here\), so using some services specially dedicated to cracking DES you will be able to crack it \(you could use [https://crack.sh/](https://crack.sh/) for example\).

The hacktricks blog mentioned that I would get the computer account hash, which seemed to be true.  It also mentioned to use the `crack.sh` service to crack it.  This is a website that offers cracking services using their pre-computed rainbow tables.

> There’s a number of articles on the LmCompatibilityLevel setting in Windows, but this will only work if a client has this setting at 2 or lower.

This matched what I had found on the machine.  It was looking good so far.

![Message from crack.sh showing the queued job](/assets/img/crack-sh2.png)

I put the hash into the format they wanted it submitted in, then entered a throwaway email address and submitted the hash. The cracking service for NTLMv1 hashes in the correct format is free.

```text
Crack.sh has successfully completed its attack against your NETNTLM handshake. The NT hash for the handshake is included below, and can be plugged back into the 'chapcrack' tool to decrypt a packet capture, or to authenticate to the server:

Token: $NETNTLM$1122334455667788$95ACA8C7248774CB427E1AE5B8D5CE6830A49B5BB858D384
Key: d167c3238864b12f5f82feae86a7f798

This run took 32 seconds. Thank you for using crack.sh, this concludes your job.
```

I received an email back from their server very quickly. It only took 32 seconds to find the hash in the rainbow table. Now I just needed to figure out how to use the machine account hash so I did some more research.

I found an article that explained how to format a query using `secretsdump.py` to dump the remote NTDS database.  This time it would be the live database and not the backup I had retrieved earlier.

Using the template from the blog I was able to dump the hashes from the machine. There were not nearly as many accounts as in the backup!  Now that I had the Administrator hash, it was time to crack it.

I was able to go through all of `rockyou.txt` in less than 10 seconds, but the password was not in it. I decided to just try to use the hash to log in instead.

Thanks to [`cube0x0`](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/9164) for making such a fun and challenging machine.  The harder-difficulty Windows challenges are rare, and I have enjoyed each one of them.  This one gave me a chance to learn a lot about using some of the standard Impacket tools in new ways, such as using Kerberos tickets along with IPv6.  I look forward to doing more like this in the future!
