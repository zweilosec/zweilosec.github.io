## HTB - Reel2

## Overview

![Descriptive information card on the machine reel2](/assets/img/0-reel2-infocard.png)

This machine was not as difficult in some respects as other Hard-difficulty machines, but the way that the machine was realistically hardened made it more challenging.  The use of some newer Windows PowerShell hardening techniques, as well as ensuring authentication was required in a key location put this machine into the "hard" category.  The path to root was otherwise rather straightforward, and just required simple attention to detail and some research to keep moving forward.

## Useful Skills and Tools

### Search for all files that contain a certain text string

Using PowerShell:

```text
dir -r C:\ -EA Silent | Select-String "Password"
```

This searches through files in the entire C:\ drive, silently ignoring errors, and selecting any that contain the word "Password" in them.

### **Mount an existing folder to a new drive letter** 

```text
New-PSDrive -Name "D" -PsProvider "FileSystem" -Root "C:\Users"\

Name           Used (GB)     Free (GB) Provider      Root                                                                                                                                         CurrentLocation
----           ---------     --------- --------      ----                                                                                                                                         ---------------
D                                      FileSystem    C:\Users 
```

This will mount the entire`/Users` folder from the  `C:\` drive to the drive letter `D:\`.  You can then access the user's folders as seen below:

```text
cd D:\Administrator
```

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.210`. The options I regularly use are:

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

```

My nmap scan showed lots of TCP ports open.  I saw 80 - HTTP, 443 - HTTPS, 8080 - HTTP, 5985 - Windows Remote Management, and RPC on a bunch of ports 6000+.

From the nmap scan I also saw a DNS domain name `Reel2.htb.local` in the port 443 information. I added this domain to `/etc/hosts` and proceeded with my enumeration.

### Port 80 - HTTP

![](/assets/img/1-80-forbidden.png)

I opened a web browser and navigated to `http://reel2.htb.local`, but this simply led to a 403 - Forbidden error page.  I also ran a dirbuster scan in the background but found nothing useful.

### Port 8080 - HTTP

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant.png)

Trying the same for port 8080 led to a login page for something called "WallStant".  It looked like some kind of social media site.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-signup.png)

I created an account after clicking on the "Sign Up" button.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-in.png)

After logging in I found myself in something that looked like an old version of Facebook.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-edit.png)

I saw a link for editing my profile. I was hoping for the ability to upload a profile picture, but unfortunately it did not seem to actually be an option.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-photo.png)

I found the option I was looking for on my 'test' user's profile page.  There was an upload button for changing the profile and banner images.  First I tested it by uploading one of my enumeration screenshots.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-nophoto.png)

After validating that I could indeed upload files, I tried to upload a PHP code exec script \(though I wasn't  sure if PHP even ran here...\) but the file had to be an image.  I was able to upload a photo, so next I loaded Burp to see if I could fool it into loading code.

![](/assets/img/2-burp-php.png)

I was able to upload my disguised PHP file, but I couldn't get code execution.  I did notice that the response contained the `X-Powered-By` header that told me that it was using PHP/7.2.32, so I checked to see if I could find any vulnerabilities associated with that version.

* [https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DEBIAN10-CURL-573151](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DEBIAN10-CURL-573151)
* [https://www.cvebase.com/cve/2020/8177](https://www.cvebase.com/cve/2020/8177)
* [https://hackerone.com/reports/887462](https://hackerone.com/reports/887462)

I found a number of vulnerabilities associated with this version, including one that pointed to a version of curl that is included that could lead to code execution using the `-J` flag is used to overwrite a local file

![](/assets/img/2-php-vuln.png)

Unfortunately, after reading the HackerOne report it seemed as if it was not useful in this case unless I could somehow make requests from the machine using curl \(not libcurl\).

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-3posts.png)

Back on the Wallstant page there was a "Trending Posts" box that had three potential usernames \(and I saw that one of my XXS tests was trending!\). I wondered what a 'fika\` was, so I looked it up.

* [https://www.swedishfood.com/fika](https://www.swedishfood.com/fika) 

> fika is a traditional Swedish coffee break with friends

I wrote it down as a potential partial password and continued on.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-users.png)

The other trending Pages tab contained more potential usernames.

```

![](/assets/img/1-8080-database.png)

Dirbuster found a `/_database` folder which contained a `wallstant.sql` SQL database.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-database-sn.png)

There was not much useful information other than version numbers.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-report1.png)

Report a problem? Sure I was having a problem with accessing your machine, could you let me in?

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-report.png)

I wasn't able to get this to connect back to my machine, though. After testing for XSS, SQLi, and doing other tests in each of the input fields, there did not seem to be much else I could do here. I decided to see if there was anything useful on port 443.

### Port 443 - HTTPS

![](/assets/img/3-443-cert.png)

I checked out the certificate, but other than the domain name I had already discovered there was no useful information.

![](/assets/img/3-443-iis.png)

The HTTPS port only led to a blank IIS Welcome page. I loaded Dirbuster again to see if there was anything other than the index page.

![](/assets/img/3-dirbuster-owa.png)

Dirbuster quickly returned a few folders, including `public` and `owa`. Both sounded interesting, so I loaded public first.

### Getting OWA credentials

![](/assets/img/3-443-owa.png)

Navigating to `https://Reels.htb.local/public` redirected to an Outlook Web Application login page. Since I had a list of names to make usernames from, I decided to try to brute force the login. Searching for OWA brute force led to a tool by `byt3bl33d3r`. 

* [https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SprayingToolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SprayingToolkit)

```text

    Do some recon and pass the custom OWA URL as the target if you really want the internal domain name, password spraying can still continue though :)
```

The first time I ran the tool it gave me a very helpful error message that explained I needed to use the full internal custom URL.  I looked up how to find the custom OWA URL, and found what I was looking for in Microsoft's Exchange documentation.

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover?view=exchserver-2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover?view=exchserver-2019)

> * Search for DNS SRV record

![](/assets/img/4-owa-autodiscovery.png)

I tried to access `autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml`, but I kept having errors and was required to login to access it.  This also prevented the OWA brute force tool from enumerating the machine.  

![](/assets/img/4-owa-broken.png)

The night I was doing this machine I kept getting crashes from the OWA web app and all sorts of other problems, including the portal being extremely slow.  I am not sure if this is normal on this machine or if it was being overly taxed by other users.

![](/assets/img/4-owa-broken2.png)

These errors made me rethink brute-forcing the portal.  Since it seemed like other users were also pounding the server, I reset the machine and looked around a bit more to see if I had missed something.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-fika.png)

I checked each profile page for clues for the password to log in.  I tried combinations of fika + 2020 etc.  For the username I tried different combinations of username, first name, and last name.

![](/assets/img/1-8080-wallstant-svenson.png)

Next I tried combinations of summer + 2020.  

### The OWA Portal

![](/assets/img/4-owa-login.png)

After a lot of tries, I was able to log into the OWA with the credentials `HTB\s.svenson:Summer2020`. 

![](/assets/img/5-owa-loggedin.png)

The first thing I noticed was that the page was in Swedish, but since I have used OWA before it was not much of a problem. There was no mail, notes, contacts, or anything to look through.

After searching for awhile for ways to steal information through Outlook, I found a few articles that explained how to get NTLMv2 hashes by sending a link to the attackers box and having the email simply viewed in the Preview Pane.

![](/assets/img/5-owa-addressbook.png)

I opened the address book, and saw a long list of addresses available. I selected all them and clicked on the button to send a new email. 

![](/assets/img/5-owa-popup.png)

I received an error from Firefox saying popups had been blocked, but clicking "Ja" \(Yes\) in the dialog box allowed the new mail window to open.

![](/assets/img/5-owa-phish2.png)

I used Google translate to send an email inviting everyone to check out the new NAS link, which was a link to my machine. I tried sending as both a web link and as an SMB share just in case.  After that I fired up `Responder` to see what I could catch.

I was able to crack the hash in just a few seconds. `k.svensson`'s password was `kittycat1`.

I was able to connect with `Evil-WinRM` using the credentials for `k.svensson:kittycat1` but the shell I got did not seem to be working properly. The `Invoke-Expression` cmdlet that `Evil-WinrM` relies on seemed to be blocked, so I loaded PowerShell for Linux instead.

I tried using the `whoami` command to find out what groups and permissions I had access to, but it didn't seem to be able to available.  This was another bad sign, after so many other locked down things.

After some testing, I discovered I could run commands embedded inside a custom function.

I found a shortcut for running commands inside short functions like this by using anonymous functions.

```text

-a----        7/31/2020  11:58 AM           2564 jea_test_account.pssc
```

This made navigating much easier since I only had to type a few characters more than typing the commands normally.  

### JEA - Just Enough Administration

Inside the `C:\Users\k.svensson\Documents` directory I found a couple of files related to some sort of test account.  I googled the `jea_test_account.psrc` file and found that is related to "Just Enough Administration", which after a little research I was able to find the Microsoft documentation that described it.

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/role-capabilities?view=powershell-7.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/role-capabilities?view=powershell-7.1)

> A role capability is a PowerShell data file with the .psrc extension that lists all the cmdlets, functions, providers, and external programs that are made available to connecting users.

This is the file that seems to be limiting the commands that are available when I logged in. This is also why `Evil-Winrm` broke, since it seems to use `Invoke-Expression` for all of its commands. I have bypassed similar restrictions by using functions before, so that is how what I tried here worked.

```text
CommandType Name Version Source

Function Clear-Host  
Function Exit-PSSession  
Function Get-Command  
Function Get-FormatData  
Function Get-Help  
Function Measure-Object  
Function Out-Default  
Function Select-Object
```

I checked the list of currently available commands, and was given a very limited set. This is how JEA limits users. However it explicitly says on the documentation page:

> For more complex command invocations that make this approach difficult, consider using implicit remoting or creating custom functions that wrap the functionality you require.

When I ran `Get-Command` again inside my custom function, the list kept going and going. It seemed like I was able to use the full gamut of commands inside a function, but very few in the normal session.

#### JEA Security Considerations

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/security-considerations?view=powershell-7.1\#jea-doesnt-protect-against-admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/security-considerations?view=powershell-7.1#jea-doesnt-protect-against-admins)

> One of the core principles of JEA is that it allows non-admins to do some admin tasks. JEA doesn't protect against users who already have administrator privileges. Users who belong **Domain Admins**, local **Administrators**, or other highly privileged groups can circumvent JEA's protections via another means. For example, they could sign in with RDP, use remote MMC consoles, or connect to unconstrained PowerShell endpoints. Also, local admins on a system can modify JEA configurations to allow additional users or change a role capability to extend the scope of what a user can do in their JEA session. It's important to evaluate your JEA users' extended permissions to see if there are other ways to gain privileged access to the system.

Now if only I could gain access to an Administrator account...

On `k.svensson`'s Desktop I found the `user.txt` proof file.

## Path to Power \(Gaining Administrator Access\)

### Enumeration as k.svensson

On the desktop I also saw a link for the sticky notes program, which seemed like a good place to search for secrets.  I searched the user's folder for any files that referenced "sticky" to see what I could find.

The Sticky Notes application was installed in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\stickynotes\`. This seemed like a likely place for the user to have stored interesting information, such as potential credentials.

There were a number of files and folders that looked interesting in this folder.  I tried searching for a database or storage file where the notes may have been contained.

Inside the `\stickynotes\Local Storage` folder there was a `leveldb` folder. After searching for `leveldb` I discovered it was a type of local database, and not related to the Sticky Notes program \(at least not in Microsoft's set up\).  It seemed like this was a custom database setup.

* [https://livebook.manning.com/book/cross-platform-desktop-applications/chapter-12/15](https://livebook.manning.com/book/cross-platform-desktop-applications/chapter-12/15)

I did some research to see if I could find out anything about this kind of custom set up for this program, and found that there was a community of people who preferred the old Sticky Notes program, and worked out ways to install and run it locally.  It looked possible that this project had been implemented here.

First I checked `Log.old` to see if there was anything useful, but it just pointed towards the other log file `000003.log`in the same directory.

One string stuck out in this log:

```text
"<p>Credentials for JEA</p><p>jea_test_account:Ab!Q@vcg^%@#1</p>"
```

It looked like I had found a password for the `jea_test_account` I had seen files referencing earlier.  I tried logging into this account like I did with `k.svensson`, but it failed to authenticate.  I did some research on how to use PowerShell remoting with JEA, and again found that Microsoft's documentation was very helpful.

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/overview?view=powershell-7.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/overview?view=powershell-7.1)

> To use JEA interactively, you need:
>
> * The name of the computer you're connecting to \(can be the local machine\)
> * The name of the JEA endpoint registered on that computer
> * Credentials that have access to the JEA endpoint on that computer
>
> Given that information, you can start a JEA session using the New-PSSession or Enter-PSSession cmdlets.
>
> ```text
> $nonAdminCred = Get-Credential Enter-PSSession -ComputerName localhost -ConfigurationName JEAMaintenance -Credential $nonAdminCred
> ```
>
> If the current user account has access to the JEA endpoint, you can omit the Credential parameter.

In order to pass both the username and password into the `New-PSSession` cmdlet, I had to create a new object that contained this information.

### Shell as `jea_test_account`

After creating an object with the credentials and specifying the connection with the configuration name, I was able to connect.

I went from one restricted account to a more restricted account.... "no-language mode".

I used `Get-Command` to see what commands I had access to, and found that it was pretty much the same list as before with one addition.  I tried to access the help information for the `Check-File` command, but I got a `Cannot find path` error.

```

The answer was in the JEA configuration files I had seen earlier.  Inside the configuration file `jea_test_account.psrc` there was a definition for a custom function `Check-File`. 

```bash
# Functions to define when applied to a session
FunctionDefinitions = @{
    'Name' = 'Check-File'
    'ScriptBlock' = {param($Path,$ComputerName=$env:COMPUTERNAME) [bool]$Check=$Path -like "D:\*" -or $Path -like "C:\ProgramData\*" ; if($check) {get-content $Path}} }
```

This function runs the `Get-Content` cmdlet, but first checks to see if the path of the file supplied contains `D:\` or `C:\ProgramData\`, and only works if this is true. It seems that there must be some file in these directories that would hopefully point me in the right direction.

```bash
[10.10.10.210]: PS>.{type jea_test_account.pssc}
@{

# Version number of the schema used for this document
SchemaVersion = '2.0.0.0'

# ID used to uniquely identify this document
GUID = 'd6a39756-aa53-4ef6-a74b-37c6a80fd796'

# Author of this document
Author = 'cube0x0'

# Description of the functionality provided by these settings
# Description = ''

# Session type defaults to apply for this session configuration. Can be 'RestrictedRemoteServer' (recommended), 'Empty', or 'Default'
SessionType = 'RestrictedRemoteServer'

# Directory to place session transcripts for this session configuration
# TranscriptDirectory = 'C:\Transcripts\'

# Whether to run this session configuration as the machine's (virtual) administrator account
RunAsVirtualAccount = $true

# Scripts to run when applied to a session
# ScriptsToProcess = 'C:\ConfigData\InitScript1.ps1', 'C:\ConfigData\InitScript2.ps1'

# User roles (security groups), and the role capabilities that should be applied to them when applied to a session
RoleDefinitions = @{
    'htb\jea_test_account' = @{
        'RoleCapabilities' = 'jea_test_account' } }

# Language mode to apply when applied to a session. Can be 'NoLanguage' (recommended), 'RestrictedLanguage', 'ConstrainedLanguage', or 'FullLanguage'
LanguageMode = 'NoLanguage'
```

The second configuration file confirmed my suspicions that I had been locked into `NoLanguage` mode, which explained why I couldn't use custom functions anymore.

```

It did not appear that there even was a `D:\` drive, so I checked out the other folder.

### Two paths forward

I did some research on how to use PowerShell to link files and how to mount new drive letters.

[10.10.10.210]: P> .{cd D:\}
```

Using this, I was able to create a `D:\` drive that linked to all of the folders and files in the `C:\` drive.

```text
[10.10.10.210]: P> .{cd D:\Users}
[10.10.10.210]: P> .{ls}

I was able to link the C drive to the D drive letter as the `k.svensson` user, however the `jea_test_account` was not able to see the `D:\` drive I had created.

```

Instead I tried mounting the `C:\Users\Administrator\` into the other folder listed in the `Check-File` script, `C:\ProgramData\`.  I did not have permissions to link to the `/Administrator` folder directly.

```text
[10.10.10.210]: PS>.{New-Item -Path C:\ProgramData\Desk\ -ItemType Junction -Value C:\Users\Administrator\}                                                                                                   


    Directory: C:\ProgramData

d----l        2/16/2021  11:19 PM                Desk
```

Instead, I created a new folder inside `C:\ProgramData\` called `\Desk` which linked to the admins folder.

### Root.txt

```text
[10.10.10.210]: PS>Check-File C:\ProgramData\Desk\Desktop\root.txt                                     
e145465135ac264800cee7d8dda0dbba
```

I was then able to use `Check-File` to read the contents of the `root.txt` by referencing the linked version inside `C:\ProgramData\Desk\Desktop\`.  

### Route two

After going through all of the trouble to create a link to the folders, I realized that I could also do it much more simply...with directory traversal!

```text
[10.10.10.210]: PS>Check-File C:\ProgramData\..\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt

e145465135ac264800cee7d8dda0dbba
```

Since the custom function was looking for a path with the `-Like` parameter and a `*` wildcard, anything could be put after the path `C:\ProgramData\`. This includes directory traversal paths such as `..\`.

Thanks to [`cube0x0`](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/9164) for creating this fun and interesting machine!  I had read about JEA when it first came out, but I didn't understand how powerfully restrictive it could be \(at least if configured securely!\).  Thank you for this opportunity to learn how to bypass these protections so I can better learn how to configure Windows networks to be more secure!
