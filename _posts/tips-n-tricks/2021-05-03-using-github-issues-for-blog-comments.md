## Migrating my blog

When I migrated my blog to GitHub Pages, one of the features I wanted to bring was the ability for readers to give feedback.  This site is all about collaboration and learning, but I did not have a great way to interact with anyone at the time.  

## utteranc.es

Enter [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es).  This is an open source project by [Jeremy Danyow](https://danyow.net/) who created the project as a POC for Microsoft's integration of GitHub Issues into their documentation.  If you appreciate being able to comment there (or here), give thanks to the author!

As Jeremy says, there are a ton of "free" comment platforms that are available.  Free as in "you are the product". Facebook, Disqus, and more all offer convenient feedback integration while also tracking everything that anyone does on your site.  They are also very bloated pieces of code that will slow down load times of your site. Utteranc.es solves these problems with a custom system that use GitHub issues as a way to store comment data without bloat or privacy issues. 

## Setting up comments on your blog

Setting this up on your GitHub Pages-powered blog is fast and easy.  

![Click the Enable button to integrate the app to your project](/assets/img/utterances-app.png)

1. First, head to [the utteranc.es app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) on GitHub to integrate and enable it.

![Select the repositories you with to enable this app for](/assets/img/utterances-app2.png)

2. Next, you will choose the repository you wish to enable app integration for.  Since I am only using this for comments on my GitHub Pages blog, I only selected my `zweilosec.github.io` repository.

![In the repo box type your github username and repository name](/assets/img/utterances-configuration1.png)

3. After choosing the repository and saving your selection, head to [https://utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es). Scroll down a little ways to the configuration section and under "Repository" type your `github-username`/`repo-to-connect` information in the `repo:` box.

4. Next, select the radio button next to the issue style that matches your preference.  This will configure `utteranc.es` to post comments to an issue based on certain criteria.  I chose for the app to create an issue with the title of the blog post so I could easily identify which post the comments belonged to.  There are a number of options to pick from, so choose the one that best fits your organizational style.

5. [Optional] You can optionally choose a label to be applied to all issues that are created by this app.  I chose to label mine `comments ðŸ’¬`.  Notice that you can add emoji to yours for more flair, or to make them stand out as comments.

![Select the visual theme you want to use for the widget](/assets/img/utterances-configuration4.png)   

6. Next you can choose a visual theme you want to use for the appearance of the widget on your website.  I chose `GitHub Dark` to match the theme of my site.

![Copy the code to add to your site by clicking the copy button](/assets/img/utterances-configuration5.png)

7. Finally, click the copy button to copy the pre-made code that contains the configuration choices you made.  You will need to copy this code to the footer of your website's HTML template (or wherever you want it displayed!). In my case the theme I use has a file called `post.html` in the `_layouts` folder.  I simply copied the code to the last section in that file and magically all posts on my site now have GitHub Issue-powered comments!
