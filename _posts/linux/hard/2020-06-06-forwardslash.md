### Useful Skills and Tools

## Enumeration

### Nmap scan

I started my enumeration with an nmap scan of `10.10.10.183`.  The options I regularly use are: 

| `Flag` | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-p-` | A shortcut which tells nmap to scan all ports |
| `-vvv` | Gives very verbose output so I can see the results as they are found, and also includes some information not normally shown |
| `-sC` | Equivalent to `--script=default` and runs a collection of nmap enumeration scripts against the target |
| `-sV` | Does a service version scan |
| `-oA $name` | Saves all three formats \(standard, greppable, and XML\) of output with a filename of `$name` |

```

This machine only had two ports open, `80 - HTTP` & `22 - SSH`.  Since I had no credentials to use for SSH I fired up a browser and navigated to `http://10.10.10.183`.

![This page was automatically redirected to from 10.10.10.183](/assets/img/1-port80-redirect.png)

When I connected to port 80 it automatically redirected to `forwardslash.htb`.  In order to redirect my request to get to this pageI had to add the following line to `/etc/hosts`:

```text
10.10.10.183    forwardslash.htb
```

After adding the hostname to `/etc/hosts` I navigated to `http://forwardslash.htb` and was greeted by webpage that had been defaced by the "Backslash Gang".

![title - Backslash Gang](/assets/img/2-forwardslash.htb.png)

The Backslash Gang left a message behind:

> Defaced • This was ridiculous, who even uses XML and Automatic FTP Logins

This looked like clues as to how they managed to get into the site.  I made note to look for services related to FTP and XML during my enumeration.  Other than this defaced page, there was not much to go off so I continued my enumeration.

### Dirbuster - forwardslash.htb

![](/assets/img/1.5-initial-dirbuster.png)

Using Dirbuster I found what initially looked like a large number of files, but after doing some closer inspection, the server was simply giving a `403 - Access Denied` error to any request that contained `.htaccess` or `.htpasswd` in it.  One accessible file stuck out, however.

![](/assets/img/2.5-note.png)

It appeared that one of the server owners had left the other a note.  The file `note.txt` mentioned two potential usernames: `pain` and `chiv` and also mentioned that there is a backup site. 

### Virtual Host Enumeration

Ippsec's video on [`HTB - Player`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpzREo7XLOY) describes "vhost enumeration" and explains how to search for other virtual hosts which map to the same IP address. From watching this video before I knew that you could enumerate these sites using the tool `gobuster`: 

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/forwardslash$ gobuster vhost -u http://forwardslash.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt 
===============================================================

===============================================================
2020/07/03 13:50:13 Finished

```

I used a wordlist of the top 110,000 most common subdomain names, and quickly found the backup site that `chiv` had mentioned in his note.  Once again, I added this domain name to `/etc/hosts` and tried to access the site.

### The Backup site

![](/assets/img/3-backup-site.png)

Navigating to `http://backup.forwardslash.htb` auto-redirected me once again, this time to a login page at [http://backup.forwardslash.htb/login.php](http://backup.forwardslash.htb/login.php).  Since I did not have any credentials, I signed up for a new account and logged in.

![](/assets/img/4-new-account.png)

Once I was logged in, I was greeted by this page.  This so-called dashboard did not offer much to do.

![Breaking the fourth wall](/assets/img/5-fun-fact.png)

The machine creator left behind a message for everyone playing with a friendly public service announcement.  Don't smoke, folks.  Its disgusting and think of all of the cat-girls you can save.

Since I wasn't finding much to use, I started employing `cewl` to create a wordlist from each of the pages on this site and from the main page.  

```text
cewl -H Cookie:PHPSESSID=h8242m3lv04gh9veco69de98ni http://backup.forwardslash.htb/environment.php >> forwardslash.cewl
```

This is a good habit to get into: always add new sites to `cewl` word list just in case.  This will often give you potential usernames, passwords, or new subdomain and sites to explore.

### Dirbuster redux - backup.forwardslash.htb

![](/assets/img/9-enumerating-backup.png)

Around this time my Dirbuster report from this new subdomain had finished.  There were a lot of results to go through, so I decided to finish going through the ones I had seen when I logged in before exploring further.

![](/assets/img/6-fileupload.png)



The URL and Submit sections on the [http://backup.forwardslash.htb/profilepicture.php](http://backup.forwardslash.htb/profilepicture.php) page were disabled, but I wondered if it was something I could easily bypass by checking the HTML code.

![](/assets/img/8-disabled.png)

 As I suspected, they had simply used the "disabled" attribute for the two sections.  Removing this code made it so the fields were again active.  

```text
<!-- TODO: removed all the code to actually change the picture after backslash gang
 attacked us, simply echos as debug now -->
```

### Local File Inclusion testing

used burp to enumerate the potential for LFI

![](/assets/img/11-etc-passwd.png)

got `/etc/passwd`

```

I found two users with login capability: `chiv` and `pain`. I have seen them both leaving notes to the other in the HTML code, and `note.txt` earlier.

While testing different methods of both uploading files and downloading files from the server, I accidentally pasted in the URL for `http://backup.forwardslash.htb/config.php` and got the back-end code file back.

```text
<?php
//credentials for the temp db while we recover, had to backup old config, didn't want it getting compromised -pain
define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'www-data');
define('DB_PASSWORD', '5iIwJX0C2nZiIhkLYE7n314VcKNx8uMkxfLvCTz2USGY180ocz3FQuVtdCy3dAgIMK3Y8XFZv9fBi6OwG6OYxoAVnhaQkm7r2ec');
define('DB_NAME', 'site');

/* Attempt to connect to MySQL database */
$link = mysqli_connect(DB_SERVER, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME);

// Check connection
if($link === false){
    die("ERROR: Could not connect. " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>
```

I now had what looked to be a password hash for the `www-data` user, but I knew from `/etc/passwd` that the user was not able to log into a shell.  I kept trying for all of the other sites I had seen in my enumeration using dirbuster such as `api.php`, `login.php`, `profilepicture.php` but each time I just got back the message "Permission Denied; not that way ;\)".  The winking smiley and the "not that way" line made it sound as if I was headed in the right direction, but I just needed to try a bit harder.  

### Bypassing web filtering

My initial thought was that there was a web-application firewall, so I searched around a bit until I found [https://www.secjuice.com/php-rce-bypass-filters-sanitization-waf/](https://www.secjuice.com/php-rce-bypass-filters-sanitization-waf/).  I kept looking for more ways after testing different bypass methods, as nothing seemed to even get a response.  I started doing a bit of research into bypassing PHP web filtering and came across a section on `PayloadsAlltheThings` that was made just for this situation with PHP file inclusion.  [https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/73aa26ba6891981ec2254907b9bbd4afdc745e1d/File Inclusion/README.md\#wrapper-phpfilter](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/73aa26ba6891981ec2254907b9bbd4afdc745e1d/File%20Inclusion/README.md#wrapper-phpfilter)

There were various code examples for bypassing PHP filters, such as by encoding the request in base64 or rot-13.  I decided to just try using the base64 encoding first, trying `pHp://FilTer/convert.base64-encode/resource=login.php`.  Luckily for me, it worked right away!  I was able to retrieve the `login.php` page, encoded in base64.  I simply had to use the decode function in Burp to get the page code.  Unfortunately there was nothing useful in that page.  After that I went through and downloaded all of the pages I had seen in `dirbuster` until I got to `pHp://FilTer/convert.base64-encode/resource=dev/index.php` which returned the base64 string:

```

Here was the hardcoded FTP-Autologin code that the Backslash Gang had so disdained, and I now had credentials for the user `chiv` .  I then tried using this username/password combo to SSH into the machine, and was greeted with a shell. 

## Initial Foothold

#### Enumeration as user `chiv`

Unfortunately, this user was not the one with the flag, so I assumed that I would need to move laterally to `pain` in order to get my first score.

linpeas.sh my go-to enumeration all-in-one script

open ports -nope

$link = mysqli_connect(DB_SERVER, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME);
```

### The python script

I had access to `pain`'s home folder, which was a bit unusual.  Inside was another note, and a python script with some ciphertext in the `encryptorinator/` folder.  

```text
chiv@forwardslash:/home/pain$ ls
encryptorinator  note.txt  user.txt
chiv@forwardslash:/home/pain$ cat note.txt 
Pain, even though they got into our server, I made sure to encrypt any important files and then did some crypto magic on the key... I gave you the key in person the other day, so unless these hackers are some crypto experts we should be good to go.

-chiv

chiv@forwardslash:/home/pain/encryptorinator$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 pain root 4096 Mar 24 12:06 .
drwxr-xr-x 7 pain pain 4096 Mar 17 20:28 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 pain root  165 Jun  3  2019 ciphertext
-rw-r--r-- 1 pain root  931 Jun  3  2019 encrypter.py
```

I exfiltrated the two files to my machine to make analysis easier.

```text
chiv@forwardslash:/home/pain/encryptorinator$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8099
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8099 ...
10.10.15.82 - - [06/Jul/2020 14:05:56] "GET /encrypter.py HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.15.82 - - [06/Jul/2020 14:06:07] "GET /ciphertext HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

The python script `encrypter.py` was redacted, and no longer contained the code to decrypt the ciphertext.  

```text
print encrypt('REDACTED', 'REDACTED')
print decrypt('REDACTED', encrypt('REDACTED', 'REDACTED'))
```

At first, I thought "lets check the backups I saw while enumerating with linpeas and see if the whole script is available".  _\(By the way, there is no "whole script" and you could go ahead and decrypt it right now.\)_

## Road to User

### Further enumeration

In the `/usr/bin/` folder there was an interesting program that stuck out to me.

```text
-r-sr-xr-x  1 pain   pain       13384 Mar  6 10:06  backup
```

This program had the setuid bit set and was owned by `pain`. I thought that I may be able to use this binary to escalate privileges laterally to `pain`.

In the `/var/backups` folder, I found a bunch of files that had been backed up, as well as another note from `pain`.

chiv@forwardslash:/var/backups$ cat note.txt 

Chiv, this is the backup of the old config, the one with the password we need to actually keep safe. Please DO NOT TOUCH.

-Pain
```

I assumed he was talking about this file: `-rw------- 1 pain pain 526 Jun 21 2019 config.php.bak` since I had found another password in the `config.php` file on the backup site earlier.  Perhaps this password was not encrypted like the previous one.  

and we do not have access to `/var/backups/recovery`. Will need to go back and check out that `backup` binary again. Since its in $PATH I just ran it.

```

hmmm...its looking for the hash of something, and says something about only working if the backup is taken in the same second, and displays the time. After some experimentation, discovered that the hash is an md5 hash of the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format. `echo $(date +%T) | md5sum | cut -c1-32` will get me a hash of the time that matches the time in the backup program, now need to script reading the file and sending the hash at the same time \(`cut` because md5sum adds  `- <filename>`at the end of its output\). 

Try it on the config backup. I had seen a long hash in the one I found before, maybe this one is pre-encryption.

Oooohhhh...need to make a symbolic link of the file, to the proper hash; also don't need to call `backup` ON the file, just run it in the directory you want it to work in

After much trial and error: getting the hash of the time wasn't working \(machine or network lag perhaps?\) so I decided to pull the hash directly from the program and symlink the backup file to it

after some more trial and error...found out that the script must be executed from user's home directory. Successfully got my test file to be read. Next, the config backup/.

Tried to decrypt the password at first, though it was not a hash despite its looks, was the actual password

```

## Path to Power \(Gaining Administrator Access\)

### Enumeration as User `pain`

Enumeration as this user was pretty short, since I had already found most everything as `chiv`.  As I always to when logging in as a new user, I checked my privileges with `sudo -l` and `groups`.

```text
pain@forwardslash:/var/backups/recovery$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for pain on forwardslash:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User pain may run the following commands on forwardslash:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/cryptsetup luksOpen *
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount /dev/mapper/backup ./mnt/
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/umount ./mnt/
pain@forwardslash:~$ groups
pain backupoperator
```

The `backupoperator` group sounded familiar.  I had seen it earlier on a folder I couldn't access in `/var/backups`. 

### The encrypted backup file

```text
pain@forwardslash:/var/backups$ cd recovery/
pain@forwardslash:/var/backups/recovery$ ls -la
total 976576
drwxrwx--- 2 root backupoperator       4096 Jul  6 19:35 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root                 4096 Jul  6 06:25 ..
-rw-r----- 1 root backupoperator 1000000000 Jul  6 19:35 encrypted_backup.img
```

 I navigated to this folder and found the file `encrypted_backup.img`.  This had to be the backup file that `pain` had `sudo` rights to manipulate.  

When trying to use `luksOpen` to decrypt the backup file, however, it prompted me for a passphrase.  The note in `pain`'s home folder had mentioned some "crypto magic" that had been applied to the key, so I went back to try to decrypt that ciphertext with the python script. 

### Python decryption script revisited

Working on script, lots of trial and error

#### Fixing UnicodeDecodeError in Python scripts

```text
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xf1 in position 932: invalid continuation byte
```

recieved error: while trying to decrypt. \(have seen this with rockyou.txt in the past as well\).  [https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/issues/190](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/issues/190) - encoding problems with rockyou.txt and ciphertext solved by using `'latin'` encoding

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/forwardslash$ vi -c 'let $enc = &fileencoding | execute "!echo Encoding:  $enc" | q' ciphertext

Press ENTER or type command to continue
```

final script:

```python
import string

def decrypt(key, msg):
  lkey = list(key)
  lmsg = list(msg)
  for char_key in reversed(lkey):
      for i in reversed(range(len(lmsg))):
          if i == 0:
              tmp = ord(lmsg[i]) - (ord(char_key) + ord(lmsg[-1]))
          else:
              tmp = ord(lmsg[i]) - (ord(char_key) + ord(lmsg[i-1]))
          while tmp < 0:
              tmp += 256
          if tmp > 256:
            tmp = 105 #randomly picked to fix out-of-range chars
          elif tmp == 0:
            tmp = 90 #randomly picked to fix out-of-range chars
          lmsg[i] = chr(tmp)
  return ''.join(lmsg)

#checks the output from crypto and sees if at least 60% is ascii letters and returns true for possible plaintext
def is_plaintext(ptext):
    num_letters = sum(map(lambda x : 1 if x in string.ascii_letters else 0, ptext))
    if num_letters / len(ptext) >= .6:
      return True

def main():
  with open('ciphertext', 'r', encoding='latin1') as ctext, open('key', 'r', encoding='latin1') as rock:
      cipher = ctext.read()
      #print(cipher + ': ' + str(len(cipher))) #for testing that the cypher is being read properly.  Needed latin encoding, as UTF-8 invalid

      for line in rock:
        line = line.strip() #remove any spaces or newlines
        #print('trying: ' + line) #testing file read purposes...too many lines of output to keep

        ptext = decrypt(line, cipher)
        
        #only print the result if it contains > 60% letters, can be tweaked.
        if is_plaintext(ptext): 
          print('plaintext found: ' + ptext)
          print('The key was: ' + line)
          exit() #exit on positive result. Remove if false positives.
        
if (__name__ == '__main__'): 
  try: 
      main() 
  except KeyboardInterrupt: 
      exit()
```

Python script ouput

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/forwardslash$ python3 ./decryptor.py
plaintext found: ©¹b`ÛºK§T=ox&yorSÔaé[8vá[(ý;fryption tool, pretty secure hÏäþð5ÖMG3õzhere is the key to the encrypted image from /var/backups/recovery: cB!6%sdHòj^@Y*$C2cf
The key was: theroadtorainbows
```

Since I had now done the hard part and decrypted the backup password with my python script, the next part was fairly straightforward.  The commands we are allowed to use with sudo spell out what we can do. 

From the CryptSetup man page: [http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/cryptsetup.8.html](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/cryptsetup.8.html).

> luksOpen   \(old syntax\)
>
>           Opens the LUKS device &lt;device&gt; and  sets  up  a  mapping  &lt;name&gt;  after  successful          verification  of  the  supplied  passphrase.  If the passphrase is not supplied via --key-file, the command prompts for it interactively.

the device name will be our backup file, the `<name>` will be `backup` \(command says `/bin/mount /dev/mapper/backup ./mnt/`\) and we will need to make a directory called ./mnt/

### Getting a shell

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

I now had an SSH key.  Since neither `pain` or `chiv` needed an RSA key to login using SSH I assumed this was `root`'s private key.

### Root.txt

Trying to login with this key, I encountered an error I had seen before.

```text
zweilos@kalimaa:~/htb/forwardslash$ ssh -i root.id_rsa root@10.10.10.183

I knew I was right that this was root's key.  _Though, as always, you have to make sure to apply `chmod 600 <file>` to your SSH private keys before use!_

```text

```

and...root.  While logging in, I received the error `load pubkey "root.id_rsa": invalid format`, though it didn't cause any issues.  According to [https://askubuntu.com/questions/698997/key-load-public-invalid-format-with-scp-or-git-clone-on-ubuntu-15-10/700172\#700172](https://askubuntu.com/questions/698997/key-load-public-invalid-format-with-scp-or-git-clone-on-ubuntu-15-10/700172#700172) this happens when the public key is missing or corrupted.  In this case it wasn't present, therefore the error.
