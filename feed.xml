It required some very specific enumeration to be done, otherwise key information would be lacking. Once these hurdles were cleared, the machine challenged me to pivot back and forth between two systems, slowly increasing my level of access with each new user account ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Hack The Box - Catch Writeup</title><link href="https://zweilosec.github.io/posts/catch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hack The Box - Catch Writeup" /><published>2022-04-14T14:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-04-14T14:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://zweilosec.github.io/posts/catch/</id> <content src="https://zweilosec.github.io/posts/catch/" /> <author> <name>zweilosec</name> </author> <category term="Hack the Box" /> <category term="Writeup" /> <summary> HTB - Catch - 10.10.11.150 Overview This medium-difficulty machine by MrR3boot from https://hackthebox.com was a very interesting challenge.

This was due to it being an actual CVE-identified vulnerability, and an acccessible endpoint.
