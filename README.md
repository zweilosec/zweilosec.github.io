# HTB Writeup Migration

![A screenshot of my chirpy themed blog site](_site/assets/img/zweilosec-whoami.png)

This is a ~~test of a~~ FULL migration of my HTB Writeups to a better looking website using the Chirpy Jekyll theme using GitHub Pages at [https://zweilosec.github.io](https://zweilosec.github.io).  My hacking notes will remain on my [GitBook page](https://zweilosec.gitbook.io/hackers-rest), as it is much better suited for that purpose.

I have also begun writing blog posts of my journey, to include how to make a cool looking site like this yourself (see [this post](_posts/tips-n-tricks/2022-07-19-jekyll-chirpy-github-pages-blog.md))!
